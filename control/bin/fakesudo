# This script is a passthrough.

# In some situations it might make sense to simply run workspace-control as
# root.  In this case, you can configure the sudo program in sudo.conf with
# the path to this program instead of the path to the real sudo.
#
# This lets you avoid setting up sudo rules for root-->root which would be
# a waste of time.
