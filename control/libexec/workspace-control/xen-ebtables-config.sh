# ABOUT #

# This script adjusts ebtables rules to stop DHCP packets from workspaces
# escaping to the site network and to prevent MAC and IP spoofing.

# 1. Is the packet coming from a workspace virtual interface?
# 2. If not, proceed without further processing.
# 3. If so, is the MAC address incorrect?  Drop the packet.
# 4. Is this is a DHCP packet?
# 5. If so, allow it to be bridged only to the appropriate interface
#    for the bridge that it is on.  No other interface on the bridge
#    will see the broadcast packet.
# 6. If not a DHCP packet, it must have the correct source IP address,
#    otherwise the packet is dropped.


# If you are running a site network DHCP server (and even if not it is good
# practice), you should add an ebtables rule to each system that drops any DHCP
# request packets coming from the peth* interfaces.

# request (these two truths are the only way to get packets to this chain),
# then send it only to the right dom0 interface (or another dom if the dhcp
# server is running in another domain).  DROP every other port on the
