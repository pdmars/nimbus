A complete overhaul of the XML format reported by plug-ins and published
by the Nagios data processing script. The new scipts no longer publish to
an MDS (this tool has been deprecated). XML is instead pushed to a web 
server for querying. 

   * nimbus_nagios_data_processing.py: This script was completely re-written
   to accommodate the new XML format. This format and the Nimbus plug-in
   architecture requires several XSLT and DOM Tree manipulations. Also, the
   XML is now validated against a XSD schema. Logging is now done to an 
   external file for easier debugging and verification.
   A configuration file, monitoring_config.cfg, now contains numerous options
   and settings that can be modified by the end user.

   * nimbus_server_script.py: Network Pools functionality was removed and 
   moved into a separate script. Also, the output/reporting mechanism for
   gathered data was changed to be more flexible and more easily support
   the new XML format. Logging code was updated.
   A configuration file, monitoring_config.cfg, now contains numerous options
   and settings that can be modified by the end user. 

   * nimbus_rt_vm_slots_script.py: A new script that is essentially the 
   Network Pools plug-in that was removed from nimbus_server_script.py. This
   script is designed to be run OUTSIDE of the Nagios utility, all by itself.
   It queries the nimbus container to determine the number of available IP
   addresses at that time. The script includes a loop that will cause it to
   run every X seconds, where X is configurable in monitoring_config.cfg. 
   Also, this script publishes to its own XML file, seperate from that created
   by nimbus_nagios_data_processing.py

   * nimbus_worker_script.py: Some renaming of classes was done to provide
   a more uniform scheme. Also, the 'VMOS' plug-in was removed for lack of 
   usage. Added the HostCpuId plug-in to report the CPUID string for the 
   host system's processor. The output/reporting mechanism for
   gathered data was changed to be more flexible and more easily support
   the new XML format. Logging code was updated.

   * cloud.xsd: The new XML format schema that the nimbus_nagios_data_processing
   script validates against.

   * nimbus_nagios_merge_nodes.xsl: An XSL to merge distinct worker node plug-in
   XML snippets into a single XML document structure

   * nimbus_nagios_rem_attrib.xsl: An XSL to strip attributes from all plug-in XML
   data. The attributes contain IP addresses and unique keys used in other XSL 
   processing, but unnecessary for the final XML format
   
   * nimbus_nagios_rem_dup_nodes.xsl: An XSL to remove duplicate plug-in XML snippets
   from the final XML tree document. Attributes are used to uniquely identify nodes.

   * nimbus_register_mds.py: REMOVED

   * nimbus_query_mds.py: REMOVED
