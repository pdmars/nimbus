# One way to do to launch the context agent at boot is to put this in
# the "rc.local" file or equivalent.  Another way is to make an init
# script, but one nice property of the "rc.local" style method is that
# those are almost always rigged to run last which is usually what you'd
# like to do.  With an init script, you'd need to fuss with ordering.

# NOTE: this requires the network.  We have seen that some Linux
# distributions do not bring up the network before calling rc.local tasks.
# In that case it is wise to put a while+sleep loop before launching the
# context-agent that will check to make sure the network is up.

# Note that you can start the context agent without fear of system alteration
# if the bootstrap file is missing.  If you did not boot the VM with 
# contextualization, the query to the metadata server (for the bootstrap user-data)
# will fail and the agent will just exit.  This allows you to leave the
# rc.local entry while you boot into "maintenance" mode to adjust something
# then save back to repository.
