ctx-agent 2.3.0
===============

* Reorganized and refactored Python scripts.

* The agent waits for network availability before starting the ctx process.
  Some distributions run the rc.local script before the network is quite ready.

* Added retry logic for local command execution (thanks to Pierre Riteau) and
  metadata server queries.
