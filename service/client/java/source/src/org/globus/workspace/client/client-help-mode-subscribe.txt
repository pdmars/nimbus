Definition:
==========

Monitor changes of single workspaces.  Will destroy a workspace automatically
if it's moved to 'cancelled' or 'corrupted'.  See optional arguments for
alternate behaviors.


Required for subscribe:
======================

  --eprFile (-e) <file>    EPR of the single-workspace resource to subscribe
                           to for notifications of changes.

Optional for subscribe:
======================

  --no-auto-destroy        Triggers client to not call WSRF destroy when
                           listening for notifications and receiving a
                           'cancelled' or 'corrupted' notification.

  --exit-state <state>     Client will exit once the given state has been
                           reached.

                           These are the current, valid state values. They
                           do not need to be capitalized:

                           Unstaged, Unpropagated, Propagated, Running,
                           Paused, TransportReady, StagedOut

  --poll-delay <ms>        Triggers client to poll for state changes instead
                           of using asynchronous notification subscriptions.
                           This is a good option to use when you are behind
                           firewalls, NATs, etc.

                           Parameter is milliseconds between polls
                           (recommend at least a second).

                           It still appears as a "subscription", it works
                           with --exit-state and autodestroy etc.

  --poll-maxthreads <num>  If polling (triggered by --poll-delay), this
                           optional argument will cap the number of threads
                           being used at once to the number you specify.
                           If the number of polls exceeds this number, all
                           will still run.  Just not necessarily with the
                           exact delay you've specified via --poll-delay.
                           Because --subscribe only works with single
                           workspaces, this currently only makes sense to
                           use when deploying groups (i.e., use this argument
                           with the deploy action).
