nimbus-cloud-client-020
-----------------------
[*] Set the permissions on --common upload so that all users can read it.

[*] Changed samples/base-cluster.xml so that is references the newer image
    base-cluster-cc14.gz

nimbus-cloud-client-019
-----------------------
[*] Removed all revocation policies from the distribution.  crl_url 
    files remain in place for users interested in having this level 
    of security.

[*] Allowed cloud-client to work if base directory has spaces
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/42

[*] Allow cloud-client to download public VM images
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/38

[*] Added an option to disable the upload spinner
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/30

[*] Made it so an error is returned when a certificate is set that
    does not exist
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/43

[*] Expand "~/" for cloud.properties options like nimbus.cert
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/5

[*] Fixed history tracking issue when more than 100 VMs are launched:
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/45


nimbus-cloud-client-018
-----------------------

[*] Changed the default settings in jets3t that caused a timeout if the 
    socket was idle for more than 60 seconds.  Some machines flush their
    cache on close and if they have a lot of memory it can exceed this 
    timeout.  This lead to an infite repeat of the upload.
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/issue/29
    
[*] Made the spinner update less frequently (once per second).  This cause
    less noise on the network for remote users.
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/issue/28

[*] Allowed the progress bar to reach 100% instead of staying at 99%
    https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/issue/31/


nimbus-cloud-client-017
-----------------------

[*] Fixed a bug when running common images from cumulus.
    https://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=7087

[*] Fixed need to have a grid proxy when running --save and key is
    unencrypted.
    https://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=7090

[*] nimbus.cert and nimbus.key properties are now resolved relative
    to the properties file they are read from, if they are not
    absolute paths.

[*] Better error reporting

[*] Fixed incorrect timestamp print.


nimbus-cloud-client-016
-----------------------

[*] Introduces Cumulus/S3 support using the Jets3t library.
    See http://www.nimbusproject.org/docs/2.5/changelog.html#2.5

[*] When using Cumulus support, the credentials for this are in the
    cloud.properties file directly, so it needs to be protected.

[*] Introduced default.properties which is a copy of distributed
    cloud.properties.

[*] Removed Teraport-specific cloud.properties, the distributed
    cloud.properties does not work with any cloud out of the box.

[*] Added support for core count to cloud.properties, administrator would
    usually recommend the number to use.
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=7062

[*] When using the cloud client, you may now export NIMBUS_X509_TRUSTED_CERTS 
    to override using the lib/certs directory. This is intentionally different
    than X509_CERT_DIR in order to allow coexistence with 'grid' software
    environments.

[*] Added support for using unencrypted keys directly instead of needing to
    run proxy-init.  The properties 'nimbus.cert' and 'nimbus.key' are consulted
    first if they exist, then a normal grid proxy search is made, then ~/.nimbus
    is consulted for an unencrypted usercert.pem and userkey.pem (which will be
    the most typical/recommended situation), then ~/.globus.  
    See the README for details.


nimbus-cloud-client-015
-----------------------

[*] New flag "--print-cxt-status" (see "--extrahelp") to find out the contextualization
    status of each node in the cluster.
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=7055

[*] Scripts use /bin/bash exclusively now.
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=7009

[*] Now fails early when known_hosts file is unknown or nonexistent
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=7004

[*] Fixed the "--conf" argument for overriding the conf location, the previous
    cloud client release broke this behavior (the fix for Bug 6873).
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=7010

[*] Friendlier unpropagation message
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6908

[*] Updated the default trusted X509 certificates.  Now includes FutureGrid,
    GridShib and BIRN CAs.  Other updates via IGTF accredited CA distribution.


nimbus-cloud-client-014
-----------------------

[*] Added name of image to output of --status
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6810

[*] Added warning when libgcj is detected
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6871

[*] Fixed bug with handling of spaces in cluster names
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6728

[*] Fixed misleading argument parsing
    http://bugzilla.mcs.anl.gov/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6873


nimbus-cloud-client-013
-----------------------

[*] Corrected sample cluster xml files

[*] Added --kernel option.  If you have coordinated with your administrator to
    use an alternate kernel, use this option to activate it.


nimbus-cloud-client-012
-----------------------

[*] Fixed bug in argument handling for --broker-url and --broker-id (bug6732)

[*] Added new meta-cloud-client that supports deploying a cluster across
    multiple clouds.

[*] Added properties for context broker URL and identity. These simplify
    launching workspaces at one site while using a context broker at
    another.


workspace-cloud-client-011
--------------------------

[*] A lone invocation of "--status" (which prints all your currently running
    instances) will now print the associated cloud handle of each workspace.

[*] Java 1.5 (Java 5) is now a requirement

[*] Support for "new style" contextualization (Nimbus TP2.2).  If you are
    using a previously created cluster image you will need to use an older
    cloud client to launch it unless you update the onboard ctx-agent.
    
    The TP2.2 service side is backwards compatible with the "old style"
    contextualization but the cloud client only supports the new one.

    ** You can only use this against Nimbus TP2.1 installations if you are
       not using contextualization **

[*] Support for contextualizing easily with EC2 resources.  See the output of
    "--extrahelp" for the new "--ec2script" option.  Sample EC2 cluster.xml
    file is @ "samples/ec2basecluster.xml"

    This will take care of the context broker interactions for you and give
    you a suggested set of EC2 commands to run (including files for metadata)
    for the virtual cluster to contextualize while running on EC2.

[*] Fixed bug in the "lib/this-globus-environment.sh" script, the X509_CERT_DIR
    variable was being set incorrectly.


workspace-cloud-client-010
--------------------------

[*] Altered the default "conf/cloud.properties" file to point to new endpoints
    for the Nimbus cloud.

[*] Added Purdue CA certificates to lib/certs {67e8acfa.0, 95009ddc.0}


workspace-cloud-client-009
--------------------------

[*] Added cluster and contextualization support.  New "--cluster" option,
    see samples directory for sample cluster definition files.

    See quickstart:
    http://www.nimbusproject.org/docs/current/clouds/clusters.html

[*] Added "--usage" (-u) option to give a short syntax reminder for people
    already familiar with the cloud client.  The "--help" option is
    still the first place to look for getting started.

[*] Added ./bin/grid-proxy-init.sh that works right out of the box.

[*] Also added ./bin/grid-proxy-info.sh, ./bin/grid-cert-info.sh, and
    ./bin/myproxy.sh

[*] Added support for image compression/decompression

    See:
    http://www.nimbusproject.org/docs/current/clouds/appendix.html#compression

[*] Cleaned up "--list" output.  Main enhancement is distinguishing the
    read-only template images from your own read/write images.
    
[*] Added "--networks" option to view available networks for clusters

[*] Distributing the most common trusted grid certificates (IGTF, TG/OSG,
    and DOE related).  This makes the embedded certificates directory
    more useful.

[*] No longer adding the embedded certificate directory to the trusted
    directory list.  Instead, the launch scripts are setting it as the only
    certificate directory via the X509_CERT_DIR environment variable.

[*] Added the ./lib/workspace.sh program for advanced/scripted uses.

[*] Added the samples directory and ./lib/check-trusted-certs.sh program
    to support the new "--cluster" option (see the cluster quickstart).

[*] Doesn't complain if history directory is missing, auto-creates directory.
    This allows you to run "rm -rf history" to clean up.


workspace-cloud-client-008
--------------------------

[*] Fixed bug that prevented "--run" working with "--newname".  That
    combination makes save-to-repository the default shutdown action (see
    --extrahelp).

workspace-cloud-client-007
--------------------------

[*] Added "--download" and "--delete" (see help).

workspace-cloud-client-006
--------------------------

[*] Added "--save" and "--newname" (see help).

[*] Removed bin/status.sh and bin/terminate.sh, incorporating them as sub-
    commands of bin/cloud-client.sh

[*] Cosmetic fix on error strings.

[*] Clarified help text: image repository is not shared.
      --list shows images you have access to run
      --transfer will put images in your personal directory


workspace-cloud-client-005
--------------------------

[*] Fix for strange DNS situations (set default for all actions:
    identity authorization preferred over host based).


workspace-cloud-client-004
--------------------------

[*] Initial release.
