    You <b>can contribute</b> without a contibutor voting process and many
    do.  All that is necessary is that you sign a contributor's license
    which allows us to freely distribute your contributions.  Your git
    author information is preserved in the repository, you just don't
    have free reign in this situation.
</p>

<p>
    You will get access to the Nimbus contributor chatroom and any amount
    of praise and encouragement you can handle :-)
