<h2>Nimbus is part of dev.globus</h2>

<p>
    To gain committer status and rights to the git repository, you need to
    be accepted into the project (via voting) and join the dev.globus
    community.
</p>
<p>
    You can <b>still contribute</b> without this voting process and many
    do.  All that is necessary is that you sign a contributor's license
    which allows us to freely distribute your contributions.  Your git
    author information is preserved in the repository, you just don't
    have free reign in this situation.
</p>
<p>
    Nimbus used to be known as "Virtual Workspaces" or the "Workspace Service"
    (which is just one Nimbus component).
    This is why the dev.globus <a href="http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Incubator/Virtual_Workspaces">Virtual
    Workspaces</a> page is named like that.
</p>

<br />

<h2>Incubator Status</h2>

<p>
    "Virtual Workspaces is an effort undergoing
    incubation at Globus. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
    projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure,
    communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner
    consistent with other successful Globus projects. While incubation status
    is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
    code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by
    Globus."
