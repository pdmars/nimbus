<p>
    Need to edit the docs?
</p>
<p>
    The first thing you should do is check the documentation tree out from git.
</p>
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
git clone git://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus.git
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<br />
<a name="local-build"> </a>
<h4>Local build _NAMELINK(local-build)</h4>

<p>
    After you have a copy of the documentation tree, building and serving it
    locally takes one command:
</p>
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
sh docs/scripts/build-and-serve-locally.sh
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
    This will print the URL to navigate to in your browser (something like
    "http://localhost:9999")
</p>

<p>
    The docs are currently going through a transition and one consequence is that this local serving tool does not present you with the style you see on the real website.

<h4>Understanding macros _NAMELINK(understanding-macros)</h4>
<!-- note, you must use the bold tags or some similar convention when talking
     about a macro on this page... since otherwise the macro processor will
     dereference it.  -->
<p>
    The docs make heavy use of m4 which is a macro processor.  The html page
    in the source tree will have something like <b>_</b>NIMBUS_HEADER in it
    which gets turned into the actual header HTML when the documentation is
    built.
</p>
<p>
    The best bet is to start out by copying already created macros.  If you want
    to create a new page, copy and paste the source contents (with the macros)
    of a page that will be next to it.  Change the page title by altering the
    argument to the <b>_</b>NIMBUS_HEADER macro.
</p>

<p>
    You will see something like "n,n,y,n,n,n,n" as an argument to some of the
    macros.  This controls which option in a list is shaded/selected (like the
    main navigation bar or a subsection sidebar).  To see which one to use,
    you may need to dip into the macro definitions in the "m4/worksp.lib.m4"
    file.  This kind of navigation "current" CSS class pattern is handled a lot better by other systems, this is a "bolt on" during the transition time.

<h4>Popular macros _NAMELINK(popular-macros)</h4>
<!-- note, you must use the bold tags or some similar convention when talking
     about a macro on this page... since otherwise the macro processor will
     dereference it.  -->
<p>
    To make a command appear like so:
</p>
    
_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
sample command
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
    ... look for examples of the <b>_</b>EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN macro which
    must be closed off with the <b>_</b>EXAMPLE_CMD_END macro.
</p>

<p>
    The <b>_</b>NAMELINK macro is useful for long pages, especially technical
    documentation.  Whenever you make an anchor like so:
    &lt;a name="some-section"&gt;
</p>
<p>
    ... put a <b>_</b>NAMELINK macro with an argument "some-section" like so:
    <b>_</b>NAMELINK(some-section)
</p>
<p>
    See an example next to the subsections on this page, it produces a hidden
    link that will show up when you hover next to where the anchor takes you.
    This lets users and developers quickly find anchors so that specific
    sections of the documentation can be referred to over email etc.

<h4>Rebuilding after changes _NAMELINK(after-changes)</h4>
<p>
    After you edit or add pages, preview the change by re-running the
    "build-and-serve-locally.sh" script.  If it was already running, simply
    press CTRL-C and launch it again.
</p>
<p>
    Once satisfied with the changes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Commit changes to git: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
cvs commit
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>Log in to the computer where the live website lives: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
ssh <b>USERNAME@login.mcs.anl.gov</b>
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>Make a scratch directory: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
mkdir /scratch/somedir && cd /scratch/somedir
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>Get the documentation and scripts from git: _EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
git clone git://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus.git
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
cd nimbus/docs/scripts
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
    <li>_EXAMPLE_GENERICCMD_BEGIN
bash docscripts/push_to_mcs_web.sh X.Y
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The "push_to_mcs_web.sh" will push any changes from the scratch directory
    to the live directory.  The "X.Y" argument controls the target directory, e.g. "2.6" would push the current branch to the 2.6 subdirectory which is symlinked as the 'current' documentation at the time of this writing. 
</p>
<p>
    If you need to change something in an older release, you must switch into that branch (using "git checkout"), pull in the necessary changes and invoke that script with the appropriate version target.
