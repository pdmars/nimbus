<h2>Workspace Group Service</h2>

<p>
    The group service allows a client to manage a set of workspaces that were
    deployed as a group.
</p>

<p>
    See the main interfaces page for an 
    <a href="index.html#groupoverview">overview of group requests</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The same operations listed on the <a href="service.html">service</a> page
    apply here.  The main differences are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The group service will apply the operation to all remaining members
        of the group.
        <br />
        <b>This includes WSRF resource destruction</b>.
        <br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>The group service WSRF resources have no resource properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    As explained in the <a href="index.html#groupoverview">group overview</a>:
    if there is an error with an operation on one of the group members, this
    is noted in a return fault along with all of the successes. <b>There
    are no error backout semantics</b> (only during factory group-create, which
    is an all or nothing process).  A group operation is simply a shortcut
    for a regular workspace service operation invoked simultaneously on
    <b>N</b> workspace EPRs.
</p>
