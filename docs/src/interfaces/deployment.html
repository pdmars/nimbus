<h2>Workspace Deployment</h2>

<p>
    Because a workspace can be deployed in the context of many different
    resource allocations (for discussion, see the
    <a href="_NIMBUS_WEBSITE/files/VW_ScientificProgrammingJournal06.pdf">Virtual
    Workspaces</a> paper, section 4),
    a separate <a href="../examples/compact/negotiable.xsd">schema</a> is
    used to both request and describe deployment-only parameters.
</p>

<p>
    When passed as a parameter to the <a href="factory.html">factory</a> create
    operation, this is treated as a deployment request and the deployment type
    can be filled in with ranges of values or exact requests.
</p>
<p>
    However, once deployed only exact values are used and the type is exposed
    as a workspace resource property. If a deployment request is rejected,
    the factory service will return a fault (see the
    <a href="factory.html">factory</a> interfaces).
</p>

<p>
    In future versions an authorized client will be able to request
    adjustments in the resouce allocation during deployment by setting the
    resource property. As a further refinement, a client will be able to
    negotiate the resource allocation.
</p>

<p>A deployment type consists of</p>

<table class="ssiimple">
    <tr>
        <td><a href="#time">DeploymentTime</a></td>
        <td>Requested running time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="#state">WorkspaceState</a></td>
        <td>Requested starting state</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>Requested resource allocation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="#number">NodeNumber</a></td>

    </tr>

        <td>Default shutdown mechanism (optional)</td>
    </tr>

        <td>Post shutdown requests (optional)</td>
    </tr>

<p>
    You can view the WorkspaceDeployment_Type definition online in the
    <a href="../examples/compact/negotiable.xsd">deployment schema</a>.
    You can also view a simple
    <a href="../examples/sample-deployment-request.xml">sample deployment
    request</a> that is installed with this version of the workspace
    client.
</p>
        
<hr />

<a name="time"></a>

<p>
    The <b>DeploymentTime</b> element is an xsd duration value that in the
    factory create call represents the requested <i>running time</i> of the VM.
    This is not the duration until the WSRF resource is terminated, just the
    time from the first start to the last shutdown.  This request is filtered
    through factory duration policies (see the
    <a href="factory.html">factory</a> page).  When used in a workspace RP,
    this duration is the running time left in the current allocation (in this
    version this part of the RP is <b>not</b> currently updated).
</p>

<hr />

<a name="state"></a>

<p>
    The <b>WorkspaceState</b> element specifies the different states a
    workspace can be in <i>during deployment</i>.  When specified in the
    request, it is a request for the service to only advance the workspace
    deployment to that specified state (default is <i>Running</i>).  When
    specified as the workspace resource property, that signals the current
    state.
</p>

<p>The WorkspaceState enumeration has these values:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><i>Unstaged</i> - The workspace's files are not staged to the site
        (within the trusted computing base (<b>TCB</b>)).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Unpropagated</i> - The workspace's files are staged to the site
        (within the trusted computing base (<b>TCB</b>)).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Propagated</i> - The workspace's files are staged to the physical
        hypervisor node where the workspace will be instantiated.  This
        state can be reached <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> the workspace is
        running.  For example, if a workspace is shutdown or serialized, it
        moves back to the Propagated state.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Running</i> - The VM is running.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Paused</i> - The VM is unscheduled from the VMM, but not
        serialized.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>TransportReady</i> - The workspace's files are packaged for
        transport after running and accessible from outside the TCB.  This
        is different than Unpropagated: in the future it will imply that
        file digests have been taken and signatures applied to metadata
        if needed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>StagedOut</i> - The workspace's files have been staged off-site,
        this is the final state possible in a 'normal' lifecycle.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Corrupted</i> - A change to this state will be accompanied
        by a fault or server side error.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i>Cancelled</i> - A change to this state implies the WSRF resource
        representing the workspace's state is being destroyed, along with all
        remaining artifacts that may have been left on the VMM node.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<a name="allocation"></a>

<p>
    The <b>ResourceAllocation</b> element is used to request and describe
    allocations such as the VM's memory, CPU percentage, and extra storage
    requirements.  The storage and bandwidth elements reference logical names
    in the workspace metadata (these are not currently supported, so we limit
    explanation).
</p>

<p>
    Only the <i>IndividualPhysicalMemory</i> and <i>Storage</i> (blankspace)
    requests in the ResourceAllocation
    element are supported in this version. Client resource property modification
    that propagates changes to the workspace during deployment is not supported
    in this version.
</p>

<hr />

<a name="number"></a>

<p>
    The <b>NodeNumber</b> element is used to request that more than one
    workspace (a group request).  The rest of the deployment request is
    taken to be for <b>each</b> of the group members.  If the client for
    example requests 2G of memory in ResourceAllocation, that is not for
    all members of the group, but for each workspace.
</p>

<p>
    For more information on group support, see the main
    <a href="index.html">interfaces</a> page and the 
    <a href="groupservice.html">group service</a> page.
</p>

<hr />
        
<a name="shutdown"></a>
<p>
    The optional <b>ShutdownMechanism</b> element is used to request that when
    the running time is over, the workspace be shutdown in a different way
    than normal.  Normally the workspace is shutdown gracefully and
    unpropagated.  The optional values of ShutdownMechanism are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Serialize - Serialize will cause the VM's state, including RAM, to be
        stored into files and then they are unpropagated.  This is not
        supported in current implementation (because of the current single-file
        propagation limitation).
    </li>
    <li>
        Trash - Trash is a useful way to end the workspace.  No files are
        unpropagated and the VM is not shutdown gracefully.  It is simply
        evicted.  In cases where you are using many workspaces as "worker"
        or "compute" nodes in a virtual cluster, this is the best way to
        end the deployment.  The next time the virtual cluster is needed,
        the compute nodes are simply started again from the template workspace.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<a name="postshutdown"></a>
<p>
    The optional <b>PostShutdown</b> tasks element currently only contains
    <b>rootPartitionUnpropagationTarget</b>.  This is for specifying an
    alternate URL for unpropagation.  You can also specify this in a late
    binding way by calling on the shutdown-save operation with an alternate
    URL (see the reference client documentation for --shutdown-save).
</p>

<p>
    If it is a group request (and hence starting from the same template image),
    then the workspace ID# will be appended on the end of each file to
    differentiate the images after running. 
</p>
