<h2>Workspace Factory Service</h2>

<p>
    The factory service allows a client to instantiate a workspace as a
    WSRF resource by using the <i>create</i> operation with workspace
    <a href="metadata.html">metadata</a> and a
    <a href="deployment.html">deployment</a> request.  The factory service's
    WSDL can be
    <a href="../examples/compact/workspace_factory_port_type_compact.wsdl">viewed
    online</a>.  It references a separate
    <a href="../examples/compact/workspace_types.xsd">types schema</a>.
</p>

<p>
    You may send <a href="optional.html">optional parameters</a> alongside the
    metadata and deployment request in the create operation.
</p>

<p>
    In the case of a group request, the factory returns a group EPR.  It
    always returns at least one single workspace reference element
    (CreatedWorkspace_Type).  In the
    case of a group request, this is a list of references (see the interfaces
    page for an 
    <a href="index.html#groupoverview">overview of group requests</a>).
</p>
<p>
    In the following picture of a single workspace reference, note that the
    resource termination timestamp (ActualTerminationTime) represents
    something different than the running duration added to the instantiation
    timestamp (which is the shutdown time), there is an offset.  The shutdown
    time is when you can't run the workspace anymore but it still might be
    unpropagating etc.  During this time the workspace representation (WSRF
    resource) still exists even though running the VM is not possible anymore.
</p>

         src="../img/CreatedWorkspace.png" />
</p>

<p>
    Currently the factory service has five resource properties: the maximum
    workspace running duration, the default running duration, the supported
    CPU architecture, the supported VMM version(s) if that is necessary to
    know, and the configured networking associations that can be requested
    (see the <a href="metadata.html#logistics">logistics</a> section).
</p>

<p>
    For notes on the current factory implementation, including fault
    descriptions, see the
    authorization explanation on the <a href="../plugins/index.html">plugins
    page</a>.
