<h3>Basic Overview</h3>

<p>
   The figure below illustrates the basic relationship between the factory and
   service interfaces.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="factory.html"><b>Workspace Factory Service</b></a> has one
    operation called <i>create</i>.  <i>Create</i> has two required
    parameters: <a href="metadata.html"><b>workspace metadata</b></a> and a
    <a href="deployment.html"><b>deployment request</b></a> for that
    metadata.  Also, create will accept <a href="optional.html">optional
    parameters</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Once created, a workspace is represented as a WSRF
    resource and can be inspected and managed through operations of the
    <a href="service.html"><b>Workspace Service</b></a>.
</p>

<p><img alt="Workspace Interface Overview"
        src="../img/interface_overview.jpg" /></p>

<p>
    An important resource property of the workspace instance is the
    <a href="deployment.html"><b>deployment</b></a> resource property (RP).
    It provides deployment information about a workspace such as running
    time, the state of the workspace, and resource allocation.
</p>

    <a href="../examples/compact/index.html">WSDL and XSD files</a> page.

<a name="groupoverview"> </a>

<h3>Group Overview</h3>

<p>
   The figure below illustrates the relationship between the factory, service,
   and now <b>group service</b> interfaces.  Here, the deployment request
   contains a request for more than one 'copy' of the metadata to be deployed.
</p>

<p>
    For example, consider the request is for five workspaces.  
</p>

<p><img alt="Workspace Group Overview"
        src="../img/group_interface_overview.jpg" /></p>

<p>
    Five network addresses are available (AllocateAndConfigure networking
    assignment is in use, see the <a href="metadata.html#logistics">logistics
    overview</a> for more information) and the scheduling process succeeds for
    the group request, so the request goes through.  <b>If there was an
    error at any time during the create process, all allocations, reservations,
    etc. will be backed out</b>.
</p>

<p>
    A group resource instance (with its own unique EPR) is created.
    Five individual workspace resource instances (each with their own EPR) are
    also created.  These six EPRs are returned by the factory to the client
    that invoked <i>create</i>.
</p>

<p>
    From this point on, each workspace has its own state, its own network
    address, etc.  These properties can be inspected (or subscribed to in
    order to receive notifications when they change) on a one by one basis.
</p>

<p>
    The group EPR is used when you want to invoke the same management operation
    on all the workspaces at the same time.  For example, it would not be
    efficient to destroy 100 workspaces one by one when you could make one
    remote call to accomplish the same thing.
</p>

<p>
    The invoked group operation is attempted on <b>each remaining workspace</b>
    in the group.  Consider an example situation where a client destroyed one
    workspace in a group on an individual basis and then later called destroy
    via the group service with a group EPR.  That group operation would
    succeed, but it would only destroy the remaining workspaces.
</p>

<p>
    If there is an error with an operation on one of the group members, this
    is noted in a return fault along with all of the successes. <b>There
    are no error backout semantics</b> (only during factory group-create, which
    is an all or nothing process).  A group operation is simply a shortcut
    for a regular workspace service operation invoked simultaneously on
    <b>N</b> workspace EPRs.
