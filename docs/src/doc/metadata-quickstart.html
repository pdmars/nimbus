<h2>Metadata Quickstart</h2>

<p>
    The <a href="../interfaces/metadata.html">metadata interface guide</a>
    goes into detail about the structure of workspace metadata, but this
    page is for <b><i>quickly getting a working metadata file together</i></b>
    if you've downloaded a VM and don't have one.
</p>

<p>
    This <b>does not apply</b> if you are using the cloud client obviously.
</p>

<h3>1. Download the template</h3>

<p>
    Download <a href="../examples/sample-workspace.xml">this example metadata
    file</a>.  Rename it if you want to.
</p>

<h3>2. Change the name</h3>

<p>
    Search the file for the instance of "http://example1/localhost/image"
    and change this to a meaningful name.  This can be any URI, the name has
    nothing to do with file locations (as far as the workspace service is
    concerned at least).
</p>

<h3>3. Change the location URL to match the file</h3>

<p>
    Search the document for "file://ttylinux-xen" and change this to match
    the filename.  If staging to the site for use with propagation, use the
    appropriate protocol, host, and directory path.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Note</i>: this quickstart does not cover multiple partitions or
    HD images yet.
</p>

<h3>4. Change the mountpoint</h3>

<p>
    Search the document for "sda1" and change this to match the partition
    of the root filesystem. 
</p>

<p>
    The necessary value for this can be determined by examining the
    "/etc/fstab" file <b>inside the VM</b> (this quickstart assumes you
    are using a Linux VM).
</p>

<p>
    (It is possible to mount the VM's filesystem locally for inspection
    and editing, for instructions see this
    <a href="../offline-editing.html">offline editing guide</a>).
</p>

<h3>5. Make sure the networking is set up</h3>

<p>
    The template metadata file expects that the VM is set up to DHCP when
    it boots.  Verify that this is true, this is often (but not always) the
    case for VMs downloaded from online 'marketplaces'. 
</p>

<p>
    The specific file(s) to inspect/edit varies among Linux distributions --
    when faced with a distribution unfamilar to you, you can often figure
    out the proper configuration by running "grep -Ri dhcp etc" ("/etc" if
    inside the VM or chrooted).  Or simply see the distribution's networking
    documentation.
</p>

<h3>6. Send!</h3>
