<h2>Introduction _NAMELINK(introduction)</h2>
<p>
The primary building block of cloudinit.d is the service.
For readers familiar with init.d, the cloudinit.d service is
akin to the <i>program</i> in init.d.  On this page we will 
describe the cloudinit.d service construct and how cloudinit.d 
starts and configures its services. 
 </p>
<p>
Often times a service is composed of many processes running in a single 
VM.  This is not strictly true.  In fact, a service can be created 
entirely without a VM, and further many cloudinit.d service's can all
run on the same machine.  However, in the classic case a VM is started 
specifically to accommodate the needs of a single server.  That VM is 
launched by cloudinit.d, a set of user defined configuration scripts are
then copied into that VM and run to contextualize it.  The healthy of that
service is then monitored by another service program.
</p>
<p>
The presentation at the beginning of this page illustrates this.
</p>
<a name="svcprograms"> </a>
<h2>Service programs _NAMELINK(svcprograms)</h2>
<p>
There are three programs that are associated with a service:
<ul>
    <li>Bootpgm</li>This program runs once to setup the service.  Often
    times it will download and install software (apt-get/yum) and then
    configure that software for use considering the values and locations
    of other services in the boot.
    <li>readypgm</li>This program is run to check the status and health
    of the service.  It can be, and typically is, run many times.  As an
    example, if the service's goal was to serve http, the readypgm would
    connect to localhost:80, download a know web page and check its content.
    If all is well the readypgm returns 0 and the service is reported as
    working.  If not, the services is marked as <i>down</i> and the
    cloud application is in need of a repair.
    <li>terminatepgm</li>The terminate program is run when a service
    is shutdown.  It is there to nicely cleanup resources associated 
    with the service.
</ul>
All of these programs are user defined and written as part of the 
process of creating a cloudinit.d service.  None of the programs 
are mandatory.  If you can create a service that does not need one
of them, by all means ignore the unneeded ones. However we have
found that they tend to be needed.
</p>
<p>
As an example let us say that we want to create a service that runs 
an apache2 web server.  We find a base ubuntu VM image on our cloud
and we associate it with our service.  Now we must create the pgms
needed to turn this VM into a cloudinit.d service.  Some possible
programs are shown below:
</p>
<div class="note">
These programs can be written in any scripting language available on the
VM on which they will be run. 
</div>

<p>
bootpgm
<div class="panel"><pre>
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get install apache2
exit $?
</pre></div>
</p>

<p>
readypgm
<div class="panel"><pre>
#!/bin/bash

wget http://localhost
exit $?
</pre></div>
</p>

<p>
terminatepgm
<div class="panel"><pre>
#!/bin/bash

/etc/init.d/apache2 stop
exit $?
</pre></div>
</p>
<p>
All of the above programs are scp'ed to the hosting machine and then
run via ssh.  Thus the user must have ssh credentials that will work on
the associated cloud and VM, and port 22 must be open to that VM.  This
is a common scenario for infrastructure clouds.
</p>

<p>
A bootlevel is a set of services that can all be started at the same time.
In other words, a set of services that have no dependencies on each other.
These services are launched at the same time.  The boot level is considered
complete when all of the service's bootpgms successfully complete.
</p>

<h2>Cloud settings _NAMELINK(clouds)</h2>
<p>
All of the information about where (what cloud) a particular service is to
be run on is set at the service level.  Thus a cloudinit.d application 
can run across many clouds.  It is entirely possible (and encouraged) to
have an application launched with cloudinit.d such that some services are 
in a private cloud and others are in a public cloud.  Right now cloudinit.d
works on EC2, Nimbus, and Eucalyptus.  It has a very modular interface that
will allow us to quickly add other infrastructure cloud types so we expect
that list to grow quickly.
</p>

<a name="deps"> </a>
<h2>Dependencies _NAMELINK(deps)</h2>
<p>
The goal of cloudinit.d is to orchestrate many services to work in concert
together to form a single application.  In order for this to be possible
the services need a way to discover information about each other.  For example,
if we are making a web server backed by a database we would make the database
one service and the webserver another (as is the case in our 
<a href="wordpress.html">wordpress</a>
example).  Because the web server is dependent upon the database, We would 
put the database at bootlevel 1 and the web server at boot level 2.
</p>
<p>
However, just having the web server wait for the database to be ready is 
not enough.  The web server must know the IP address and the port number
of the data base in order to connect to it.  Further they likely need some 
sort of shared secret for making a secure connection.  Cloudinit.d handles
the exchange of this, and similar types of dependency information.  Any 
service is allowed to lookup another service (that is at a lower boot level)
and request an attribute from it.  There is a small set of statically 
defined attributes that a service has (ex: hostname, IaaS instance id, etc)
and the service can further defined its own setup attributes.
</p>
<p>
This secure exchange of service defined attributes is what makes 
cloudinit.d a powerful tool.
