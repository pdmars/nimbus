<p>
Solving the problems in computing often requires a set of services all 
working together in concert.  As distributed computing has evolved, the 
management and coordination of these services has become a complicated 
task.  The advent of cloud computing has exacerbated this problem by 
providing its users with an explosion of virtual resources
that need to be started, managed, monitored, and notified of each others
existence and operational state.
</p>
<p>
Very little can be assumed about the network locations of these 
virtual machines, their IP addresses are dynamically provisioned and 
they can be spread across many clouds potentially all over the world.  
In order for the VMs to work in concert, 
It is critical that communication channels are established. 
</p>
<p>
How can we organize, manage, and coordinate 
the bootstrap process of these ever growing cloud applications?  
Infrastructure clouds have delivered the resources but can they be 
leveraged in a sane and repeatable way?  Once these applications are 
running how can we ensure that they continue to work and can we recover 
from failures without having to waste valuable time and potential data 
by completely restarting them? 
</p>

To address these questions the Nimbus 
Project is proud to introduce cloudinit.d.  cloudinit.d is a tool 
for launching, 
configuring, monitoring, and repairing a set of interdependent virtual 
machines in an IaaS cloud or over a set of IaaS clouds.  A single launch 
can consist of many VMs and can span multiple IaaS providers, including 
offerings from commercial and academic space.
