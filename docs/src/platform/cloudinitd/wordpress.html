<h2>Introduction _NAMELINK(introduction)</h2>

<p>
This example will launch an EC2 cloud application which runs a
<a href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress</a>.  Two virtual machines
will be launched, the first runs a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
database, and the second runs the wordpress service.
</p>
<div class="note">
Running VMs on EC2 requires an EC2 account which will be charged.  At the 
time of this writing the rates for an m1.small instance is $0.085 per hour.
Rates can be checked <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">here</a>

<a name="quickstart"> </a>
<h2>Quick-Start _NAMELINK(quickstart)</h2>
<p>
Once you have cloudinit.d installed the following commands will get this 
example, boot it in EC2, and present you will a functional wordpress service. 

<tt class="panel"> <pre>
$ export CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;your EC2 access key&gt;
$ export CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SECRET_KEY=&lt;your EC2 secret key&gt;
$ export CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SSHKEY=&lt;the path to your ssh key&gt;
$ export CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SSHKEYNAME=&lt;the name of your ssh key in EC2&gt;
$ wget http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/wordpress.tar.gz
$ tar -zxf wordpress.tar.gz
$ cloudinitd -v -v -v boot wordpress/top.conf
</pre></tt>

When this completes a full wordpress service will be ready for your use.
The output of cloudinit.d will look something like this:

<tt class="panel"> <pre>
Starting up run c80e7e2c
    Started IaaS work for mysql
    Started IaaS work for wordpress
Starting the launch plan.
Begin boot level 1...
    Started mysql
        SUCCESS service mysql boot
        hostname: ec2-50-17-78-14.compute-1.amazonaws.com
        instance: i-f8380797
SUCCESS level 1
Begin boot level 2...
Begin boot level 2...
    Started wordpress
    SUCCESS service wordpress boot
        hostname: ec2-174-129-163-229.compute-1.amazonaws.com
        instance: i-ca3807a5
SUCCESS level 2
</pre></tt>
Note the second hostname printed under the <i>wordpress</i> service 
information: ec2-174-129-163-229.compute-1.amazonaws.com.  Simply
point your web browser at 
http://ec2-174-129-163-229.compute-1.amazonaws.com/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php
and you have your own personal wordpress service!
<div class="note">
For this example to work you need your default security group to have
port 22, 80 and 3306 open.
</div>
</p>

<a name="cleanup"> </a>
<h2>Cleanup _NAMELINK(cleanup)</h2>

<p>
You can terminate the entire cloud application with a single command as
well.  The first thing to note is the <i>run name</i> which is printed
out in the first line of the boot output:
<tt class="panel"> <pre>
Starting up run c80e7e2c
</pre></tt>
In out case it is <i>c80e7e2c</i>.  To terminate the launch run the following command:

<tt class="panel"> <pre>
$ cloudinitd -v -v -v terminate c80e7e2c
Terminating c80e7e2c
Begin terminate level 2...
    Started wordpress
    SUCCESS service wordpress terminate
        hostname: None
        instance: i-ca3807a5
SUCCESS level 2
Begin terminate level 1...
Begin terminate level 1...
    Started mysql
    SUCCESS service mysql terminate
        hostname: None
        instance: i-f8380797
SUCCESS level 1
deleting the db file /home/bresnaha/.cloudinitd/cloudinitd-c80e7e2c.db
</pre></tt>
All of the resources associated with your cloud application will now
be cleaned up.

</OBJECT>

<a name="launchplan"> </a>
<h2>Launch plan _NAMELINK(launchplan)</h2>
<p>
The details of the launch are found in the launch plan.  The first file is
<i>top.conf</i>:

<tt class="literal"> <pre>
[defaults]
iaas_key: env.CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_ACCESS_KEY
iaas_secret: env.CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SECRET_KEY
localsshkeypath: env.CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SSHKEY
sshkeyname: env.CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SSHKEYNAME

[runlevels]
level1: mysql_level.conf
level2: wp_level.conf
</pre></tt>

Here we see above that key security information is gathered from the 
environment variables (this is why we had to set the prior to launch
in the quick start).  We also see that there are two run levels.  The 
first handles the MySQL server, and once that is done, The second uses 
it to handle the wordpress service.
</p>

<p>
If we look at the two run level files <i>mysql_level.conf</i> and
 <i>wp_level.conf</i> we see that each has a section that starts with
<i>svc</i>.  What follows <i>svc-</i> is the name of the service to be 
described.  In svc-wordpress and svc-mysql
we see three similar values and three different ones.
First lets look at the similar values:
<tt class="panel"> <pre>
ssh_username: ubuntu
image: ami-ccf405a5
allocation: m1.small
</pre></tt>
These lines tell cloudinit.d to launch the image name <i>ami-ccf405a5</i> 
(this is a standard ubuntu10.10 image) as a m1.small instance.  The
<i>ssh_username</i> tells cloudinit.d which username can be accessed with 
the previously established keys.
</p>
<p>
Those line are enough to establish two base virtual machines in the associated
cloud.  From there the next  thing to do is customize these VMs to do their
needed jobs, become a mysql server and a wordpress server.  The next three 
lines of the configuration file handle this.
</p>
<p>
bootpgm points to a script that is copied into the virtual machine 
where it is run.  This script should download, install, and configure
the machine to do its job.  In the case of the MySQL server software
is installed with apt-get and configured.  In the wordpress case
wordpress is downloaded and installed.  
</p>
<p>
Further, the hostname where 
the MySQL service is running is passed to the wordpress VM so that it
can connect to it.  This is handled with the <i>deps</i> directive and the 
<i>bootconf</i> directive.  The files in this launch plan serve as a good
example for how this works.
</p>

<a name="troubleshooting"> </a>
<h2>Trouble Shooting _NAMELINK(troubleshooting)</h2>

<p>
When a service is launched a series of log files are created under:
~/.cloudinitd/&lt;run name&gt;.  Valuable information about the progress
of a launch can be found in these directories.
