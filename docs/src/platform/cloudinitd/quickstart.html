<h2>Download and install cloudinit.d _NAMELINK(download)</h2>

<p>
cloudinit.d is a python setup package registered with 
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">pypi</a> which means you can <i>easy_install</i>
it.  From a python virtualenv or an account with access to the systems
libraries and pythin in its path run:
<tt class="literal"> <pre>
$ easy_install cloudinitd
</pre></tt>
This will download cloudinit.d and all of its dependencies and install them.
</p>
<p>
If you prefer to fetch the tarball and have a more manual install you can
get the latest release <a href="">here</a>.  To install it untar, change
<tt class="literal"> <pre>
$ tar -zxvf cloudinitd-latest.tar.gz
...
$ cd cloudinitd-&lt;version&gt;
$ python setup.py install
</pre></tt>
to the base directory and run <I>python setup.py install</I>
</p>
<p>
You can new test it out!
<tt class="literal"> <pre>

<h2>Create a launch plan _NAMELINK(launchplan)</h2>

<p>
    A launch plan is set of configuration files that tell cloudinit.d what 
    VM images to boot and in what order.  It is where the specific cloud
    to use is set along with the credentials needed to access that cloud.
    All aspects of contextualization and testing are also set in the
    launch plan. 
</p>
<p>
    Here we will walk through a very basic launch plan.  To minimize potential
    confusion we will only show a bare minimum set of cloudinit.d features.
</p>
<a name="ec2"> </a>
<h2>Simple EC2 example _NAMELINK(ec2)</h2>
<p>
    In this example we show a minimal launch plan needed to start a 
    VM on Amazon's EC2.  In order to use it you will need an account with
    AWS.
    To get an EC2 account see: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>
</p>
<div class="note">
For this example to work you need your default security group to have
port 22 and 80.
</div>

<p>
    The launch plans used in this example can be found at:
    <a href="helloec2.conf">helloec2.conf</a> and
    <a href="helloec2_level1.conf">helloec2_level1.conf</a> 
</p>

<a name="top"> </a>
<h2>Top level launch plan _NAMELINK(top)</h2>
<p>
In this very simple example the top level configuration file simply enumerates
the run levels.  Because we are only launching a single virtual machine 
there is only 1 run level.  The entire configuration file follows:
</p>
<div class="panel"><pre>
[runlevels]
level1: helloec2_level1.conf
</pre></div>

<a name="level"> </a>
<h2>Run level configuration _NAMELINK(level)</h2>
<p>
    In this example all of the interesting information will be held in the 
    run level configuration file.  We will need to have the following
    information in order to run this example.
    <UL>
        <li>EC2 access key</li>
        <li>EC2 secret key</li>
        <li>EC2 ssh key name</li>
        <li>path to the matching ssh key</li>
    </UL>
    These are all very standard things that EC2 users have.  If you are not 
    familiar with these items please check out the EC2 tutorial 
    <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have obtained the above information please set the following
    environment variables in the following way:
<div class="panel"><pre>
% export CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;EC2 access key&gt;
% export CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SECRET_KEY=&lt;EC2 secret key&gt;
% export CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SSHKEY=&lt;EC2 ssh key name&gt;
% export CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SSHKEYNAME=&lt;path to the matching ssh key&gt;
</pre></div>
</p>
<p>
    Now that we have all of the security information in place we will look
    at the run level configuration file:
</p>
<div class="panel"><pre>
[svc-sampleservice]

iaas_key: env.CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_ACCESS_KEY
iaas_secret: env.CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SECRET_KEY
localsshkeypath: env.CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SSHKEY
keyname: env.CLOUDBOOT_IAAS_SSHKEYNAME

iaas: us-east-1
image: ami-30f70059
ssh_username: ubuntu
allocation: t1.micro

bootpgm: bootpgm.py
</pre></div>

<div class="note">
    The name of this configuration section is <i>svc-sampleservice</i>.
    What this tells cloudinit.d is that it is a service (svc-) named
    sampleservice.  The name must start with <i>svc-</i>
</div>
<p>
The first thing to note from this file are the values corresponding to the 
environment variables we just set.  The directive <b>env.</b> tells cloudinit.d
to get the value for this field from the environment variable of the
following name.  The values for these 4 entries are described above.
</p>
<p>
The remaining entries have the following meanings:
<UL>
    <li>iaas</li>This is a string describing the cloud with which we will be 
    interacting.  In this case it is us-east-1 on EC2.
    <li>image</li>This is a handle to an image.  The format of this handle
    will vary with different clouds.  In our case we are using EC2 so the
    format is ami-XXXXXXX.  The specific AMI for use with this example is
    ami-30f70059.  It is a publicly available ubuntu image with an apache
    server installed.
    <li>ssh_username</li>This is the username that the VM image has 
    associated with the localsshkeypath defined above.    
    <li>allocation</li>This string tells the cloud details of the resources
    we want allocated with the image.  In our case we pick t1.micro because
    it is the cheapest.
    <li>bootpgm</li>This value is described in the next section.
</UL>
</p>

<a name="bootpgm"> </a>
<h2>Bootpgm _NAMELINK(bootpgm)</h2>
<p>
This value points to a program that will be run on your once to contextualize
it.  Once you boot your launch program cloudinit.d will wait until its 
sshd service is running.  Once it is this program is uploaded and run as the 
user defined by <i>ssh_username</i>, in our case <i>ubuntu</i>.  Below
is the example bootpgm.
</p>
<div class="panel"><pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import os

f = open("hello.html", "w")
f.write("&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello cloudinit.d!&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;")
f.close()

cmd = "sudo cp hello.html /var/www/"
os.system(cmd)

sys.exit(0)
</pre></div>
<p>
This is a very simple program which simply creates a web page.  You can also
see it here <a href="ec2bootpgm.py">ec2bootpgm.py</a> 
</p>
<a name="boot"> </a>
<h2>Terminate _NAMELINK(boot)</h2>
<p>
Now that we have and understand a launch plan, lets put it into action with cloudinit.d:
</p>
<div class="note">
    You will be charged by AWS for running this command.  At the time
    of this writing the charges are less than 3 cents per hour.
</div>

<div class="panel"><pre>
$ cloudinitd -v -v -v boot helloec2.conf 
Starting up run 54c03415
    Started IaaS work for sampleservice
Starting the launch plan.
Begin boot level 1...
    Started sampleservice
    SUCCESS service sampleservice boot
        hostname: ec2-50-17-4-154.compute-1.amazonaws.com
        instance: i-2ae3a245
SUCCESS level 1

</pre></div>
<div class="note">
The above session shows a successful boot of a launch plan.  Notice the use 
the <i>-u</i> option.  This simply increases the amount of output that we will
see.
</div>

<p>
Your VM was successfully started!  The output shows the hostname assigned to
the boot as <i>ec2-50-17-4-154.compute-1.amazonaws.com</i>.  If we point a
web browser at http://ec2-50-17-4-154.compute-1.amazonaws.com/hello.html
we should see the message we configured with our bootpgm.py program.
</p>
<a name="terminate"> </a>
<h2>Terminate _NAMELINK(terminate)</h2>
<p>
In order to avoid further service charges from AWS we should clean up this
launch.  This is done by taking the run name from the output of the boot,
in our case 54c03415 and giving it as an option to the terminate directive:
</p>

<div class="panel"><pre>
$ cloudinitd -v -v -v terminate 54c03415
Terminating 54c03415
Begin terminate level 1...
    Started sampleservice
    SUCCESS service sampleservice terminate
        hostname: None
        instance: None
SUCCESS level 1
deleting the db file /home/bresnaha/.cloudinitd/cloudinitd-54c03415.db

</pre></div>
