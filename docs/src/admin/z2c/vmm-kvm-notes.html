<h2>Install VMM KVM Software</h2>

<p>
There are a few key differences between using Nimbus with Xen and using it 
with KVM.  Here present some notes about Nimbus when using KVM.  Detailed
instructions are threaded throughout the <a href="vmm-setup.html">vmm setup
</a> guide.  This page
give somes tips and reminders that will help the reader follow the remainder
of the guide.
</p>

<p>
If your Linux distribution has a nice guide for initial testing of Xen, it would be good to follow that advice to weed out any major problems using a known and controlled environment.

<h3>Sample image _NAMELINK(kvmimage)</h3>
<p>
The Nimbus project has a sample KVM image that can be used
for testing that KVM, libvirt, and Nimbus are installed correctly.  The 
image is available 
    <a href="http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/ubuntu10.10.gz">here</a>
</p>    
<p>
  It is a base ubuntu10.10 VM.  It runs an SSH server when it boots.

<h3>kvmlibvirt commands _NAMELINK(kvmlibvirt)</h3>

<p>
When using libvirt on Xen we will often reference the command virsh. virsh
takes many commands, but when running with Xen it will always take the option
-c 'qemu:///system'
</p>

<p>
For example: 
<div class="panel"><pre>
root # virsh -c 'qemu:///system' list
</pre></div>
</p>
