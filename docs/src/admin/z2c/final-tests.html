<h2>Final Tests</h2>

<p>
    On this page, you will remotely test the system with the cloud
    client like you did before.  But this time, a virtual machine
    will be started for you as expected.
</p>

<h3>Back to the cloud client</h3>
<p>
    Several pages ago, we set up and tested the cloud client against
    the service. Now we are ready to revisit that client installation
    and try again, but with a real VM. First off, run the status
    and list commands to ensure that the IaaS and repository services
    are still running correctly.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ cd nimbus-cloud-client/
</pre>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --status

Querying for ALL instances.

There's nothing running on this cloud that you own.
</pre>

<pre class="panel">
$ bin/cloud-client.sh --list

No files.
</pre>

<p>
    If these commands succeeded, we can move on and attempt to upload a
    real VM image to the repository.
</p>
<h3>Upload image</h3>

<p>It is recommended to start with the image that you used earlier to test the VMM.
   If you don't still have it, fetch it again. Remember that there is a different
    sample image for Xen vs. KVM.
</p>

<div class="xenpanel">
<div class="panel"><pre>
$ wget http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/nimbus-z2c.gz
$ gunzip nimbus-z2c.gz
</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="kvmpanel">
<div class="panel"><pre>
$ wget http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/ubuntu10.10.gz
$ gunzip ubuntu10.10.gz
</pre></div>
</div>

<p>
    Now use the cloud-client to upload the VM image to the Cumulus repository.
    For the following commands, replace <tt class="literal"><b><em>image</em></b></tt>
    with the name of the image file you just unzipped. So <tt class="literal">nimbus-z2c</tt>
    or <tt class="literal">ubuntu10.10</tt>.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --transfer --sourcefile <b><em>image</em></b>

Transferring
  - Source: <em>image</em>
  - Destination: cumulus://Repo/VMS/04NjWi75iz1TzNf4Y3zvU/<em>image</em>
</pre>

<p>
    Now the list operation should show the new image.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --list

[Image] '<em>image</em>'                     Read/write
        Modified: Jun 7 2010 @ 12:43   Size: 288358400 bytes (~275 MB)
</pre>
<h3>Start VM</h3>

<div class="kvmpanel">
    <p>
        For KVM you need to make an additional configuration change to the
        <tt class="literal">cloud.properties</tt> file. You must tell Nimbus to
        treat the image as a disk, not just a single partition. Add the following
        line to <tt class="literal">conf/cloud.properties</tt>:
    </p>
    <pre class="panel">
    vws.metadata.mountAs=hda
    </pre>

    <p>
        Once you have everything working, you should also add this (along with any
        other customizations) to the cloud properties template file used for new
        users. It is located in the service installation at
        <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/var/cloud.properties.in</tt>.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Now we are ready to boot this image and see if we can ssh into it.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --run --name <b><em>image</em></b> --hours 1

Launching workspace.

Workspace Factory Service:
    https://nimbus.example.edu:8445/wsrf/services/WorkspaceFactoryService

Creating workspace "vm-001"... done.


       IP address: 128.135.125.25
         Hostname: x001.nimbus.example.edu
       Start time: Mon Jul 05 21:27:20 CDT 2010
    Shutdown time: Mon Jul 05 22:27:20 CDT 2010
 Termination time: Mon Jul 05 22:37:20 CDT 2010

Waiting for updates.

</pre>

<p>
    If all goes well, a VM should be booting and its IP should be
    printed to the screen. The client will not exit until the
    image is distributed and the VM is booting. When this happens,
    you can attempt to SSH into the new VM. SSH may not immediately
    work because the VM may take some time to boot and start its
    networking and daemons.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ssh root@x001.nimbus.example.edu
</pre>

<p>
    Notice also that a "handle" was printed out to the screen for
    this launch. In the example above, this handle is
    "<tt class="literal">vm-001</tt>". When you are ready to destroy
    a running VM, you do so using this handle.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --terminate --handle vm-001
</pre>

<p>
    The cloud client has many other options and features. For details,
    check <tt class="literal">--help</tt> and the
    <a href="http://www.nimbusproject.org/docs/2.4/clouds/cloudquickstart.html">client quickstart</a>.
</p>

<h3>Once more, with contextualization</h3>

<div class="kvmpanel">
    <p>
        The KVM sample image does not support contextualization at this time, so you
        can skip this step.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    The cloud client also supports launching VMs with <em>contextualization</em>.
    The <tt class="literal">nimbus-z2c</tt> image has an agent installed that securely
    contacts a broker and exchanges information about itself and other nodes. This allows
    launching groups of nodes that are contextualized into clusters.
</p>

<div class="note">
    <p class="note-title">Metadata server</p>
    <p>
        This test will fail if you have not configured the
        <a href="networking-setup.html#metadata-server">metadata server</a>. The VM will launch
        but get stuck in the phase "<tt class="literal">Waiting for context broker updates</tt>".
    </p>

</div>


<p>
    The <tt class="literal">nimbus-z2c</tt> image supports simple contextualization.
    Each VM's SSH public key will be retrieved by the cloud client and installed into
    your <tt class="literal">~/.ssh/known_hosts</tt> file. If you launch multiple
    <tt class="literal">nimbus-z2c</tt> VMs, they will be contextualized and
    configured with host-based authentication.
</p>
<p>
    Clusters are launched using a cluster document which describes the instances
    and their relationships. An example for <tt class="literal">nimbus-z2c</tt>
    is available <a href="http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/nimbus-z2c.xml">here</a>.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ wget http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/nimbus-z2c.xml
</pre>

<pre class="panel">
&lt;cluster&gt;
  &lt;workspace&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;node1&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;image&gt;nimbus-z2c&lt;/image&gt;
    &lt;!-- How many to launch --&gt;
    &lt;quantity&gt;1&lt;/quantity&gt;

    &lt;nic wantlogin="true"&gt;public&lt;/nic&gt;

    &lt;ctx&gt;
      &lt;provides&gt;
          &lt;identity /&gt;
          &lt;role&gt;testrole1&lt;/role&gt;
      &lt;/provides&gt;
      &lt;requires&gt;
          &lt;identity /&gt;
          &lt;role name="testrole2" hostname="true" pubkey="true" /&gt;
          &lt;role name="testrole3" /&gt;
      &lt;/requires&gt;
    &lt;/ctx&gt;
  &lt;/workspace&gt;
&lt;/cluster&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    Run the cloud client again, specifying this file with
    the <tt class="literal">--cluster</tt> argument.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --run --cluster nimbus-z2c.xml --hours 1

Requesting cluster.
  - node1: image 'nimbus-z2c', 1 instance

Context Broker:
    https://nimbus.example.edu:8445/wsrf/services/NimbusContextBroker

Created new context with broker.

Workspace Factory Service:
    https://nimbus.example.edu:8445/wsrf/services/WorkspaceFactoryService

Creating workspace "node1"... done.
  - 128.135.125.21 [ x001.nimbus.example.edu ]


Launching cluster-001... done.

Waiting for launch updates.
  - cluster-001: all members are Running

Waiting for context broker updates.
  - cluster-001: contextualized

SSH trusts new key for x001.nimbus.example.edu  [[ node1 ]]
</pre>

<p>
    If all went well, you should see output similar to the example. The VM
    was booted and its SSH key was sent back to the client via the Context
    Broker. If you want to try booting multiple VMs in a cluster, edit the
    XML file and adjust the quantity element then try again. You can also
    check out the
    <a href="../../clouds/clusters.html">cluster guide</a>
    for more information.
</p>

<p>
    If the VM successfully launches but the cloud client gets stuck with the
    message "<tt class="literal">Waiting for context broker updates</tt>",
    try logging into the VM with SSH and examining the context agent log file
    <tt class="literal">/opt/nimbus/ctxlog.txt</tt>. There may be a problem
    with the context broker or metadata server.
</p>

<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>
    Once all of these tests succeed, your cloud is up and running. At this
    point you probably want to 
    <a href="../reference.html#resource-pool">configure more VMM nodes</a>
    and add them to the resource pool. You may also want to check out the
    <a href="../reference.html">reference page</a> sections for more
    a list of other configurations and information.
</p>
<p>
    You can also now start enabling remote users.  You should familiarize yourself with the <a href="../reference.html#user-management">user management</a> tools, the <a href="../reference.html#nimbusweb-config">web application</a> that is available for securely distributing credentials, and look into configuring <a href="../reference.html#group-authz">per-user rights and allocations</a>.
