<h2>Install VMM Xen Software</h2>

<p>
There are a few key differences between using Nimbus with Xen and using it 
with KVM.  Here present some notes about Nimbus when using Xen.  Detailed
instructions are threaded throughout the <a href="vmm-setup.html">vmm setup
</a>guide.  This page
give somes tips and reminders that will help the reader follow the remainder
of the guide.
</p>

<h3>Xen 3.x _NAMELINK(xenversion)</h3>
<p>
We strongly recommend using your Linux distribution's package management and 
user guides.  If your Linux distribution doesn't support Xen packages you can 
try installing from source or binary, starting at 
<a href="http://xen.org/">xen.org</a> 
</p>
<p>
If your Linux distribution has a nice guide for initial testing of Xen, it would be good to follow that advice to weed out any major problems using a known and controlled environment.

<a name="xenimage"> </a>
<h3>Sample image _NAMELINK(xenimage)</h3>
<p>
The Nimbus project has a sample image compatable with Xen that can be used
for testing that Xen, libvirt, and Nimbus are installed correctly.  The 
image is available 
    <a href="http://www.nimbusproject.org/downloads/nimbus-z2c.gz">here</a>
</p>    
<p>
  It is a minimal Debian VM with very little installed.  It runs an SSH server when it boots.  If you have console access to it, you will be able to log in to it using the <tt class="literal">root</tt> account with password <tt class="literal">root</tt>.
    It also runs the Nimbus context agent on boot, so you can use it to test contextualization.
</p>


<a name="xenkernel"> </a>
<h3>Pick the kernel to use _NAMELINK(xenkernel)</h3>
<p>
Unlike KVM, Xen does not have the kernel built into its images.  Because of 
this a kernel needs to be associated with images when they are launched.  The
kernels available for boot can be found in /boot/.  You may need the matching
initrd file as well.  The kernel and initrc files that you want to associate
with Nimbus VM launches must be copied to 
/opt/nimbus/var/workspace-control/kernels
</p>

<a name="xenebtables"> </a>
<h3>Xen and ebtables _NAMELINK(xenebtables)</h3>
<p>ebtables requires kernel support in dom0, the default Xen kernel includes 
this support.  If your domain 0 kernel does not include these for some reason, 
the options to enable are under 
<tt class="literal">Networking :: Networking options :: Network packet filtering :: Bridge Netfilter Configuration :: Ethernet Bridge Tables</tt>
</p>
</div>

<a name="xenlibvirt"> </a>
<h3>xenlibvirt commands _NAMELINK(xenlibvirt)</h3>

<p>
When using libvirt on Xen we will often reference the command virsh. virsh
takes many commands, but when running with Xen it will always take the option
-c 'xen+unix:///'
</p>

<p>
For example: 
<div class="panel"><pre>
root # virsh -c 'xen+unix:///' list
</pre></div>
</p>

<p>
  For virsh to work with Xen in this way you will need to enable Xen to work with domain sockets. In the <tt class="literal">/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp</tt> file, activate the <tt class="literal">xend-unix-server</tt> configuration by including <tt class="literal">yes</tt>. Then uncomment the <tt class="literal">xend-unix-path</tt> setting and note the value (for example <tt class="literal">/var/lib/xend/xend-socket</tt>).  <i>Note that using Xen with the HTTP server method instead of this domain socket method is typically not secure</i>.
