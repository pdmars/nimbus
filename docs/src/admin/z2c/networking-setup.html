<h2>Install DHCPd and Configure Networking</h2>

<p>
    On this page, you will install a central DHCPd daemon (or
    integrate with an existing one) and configure the networking
    addresses you want to give out to virtual machines when they
    boot.
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
    When a VM is started using Nimbus, it is provided a network IP address
    via DHCP. You must configure a pool of available networks and addresses
    in the service. You must provide at least as many addresses as VMs you
    want to run simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to configuring available addresses in the Nimbus service,
    you must also set up a DHCP server to actually hand out these addresses.
    This will be discussed in depth shortly.

</p>
<h3>Network pools</h3>
<p>
    Take a look at the
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/network-pools/</tt>
    directory on your service node. Each file represents a single network which can
    be provided to virtual machines. Each network can be bridged to different (or the same)
    physical networks and a single VM can be connected to multiple networks. When a VM is launched,
    one or more networks are requested by the client.
</p>

<p>
    Traditionally, Nimbus installations are configured with two networks,
    <tt class="literal">public</tt> and <tt class="literal">private</tt>.
    Start with the <tt class="literal">public</tt> file as it contains
    a lot of helpful documentation. For each network, you must configure
    a DNS server as well as a list of available network slots.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
# DNS server IP address (or 'none')
192.168.0.1

# hostname ipaddress gateway broadcast subnetmask [MAC]

pub02 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.1 none none
pub03 192.168.0.3 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.255 255.255.255.0
pub04 192.168.0.4 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.255 255.255.255.0
</pre>

<p>
    The only truly required fields are the hostname and IP. The gateway, broadcast,
    and subnet may be specifed as 'none' (but you probably don't want to).
    You can also optionally specify a hardware MAC address as the last field. If you
    do not specify a MAC, the Nimbus service will generate one for you.
</p>

<h3>DHCP server</h3>
<p>
    While addresses for VMs are configured and chosen within the Nimbus service,
    they are physically queried via an external DHCPd service. There are two ways
    of arranging the DHCP configuration.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Centralized -- a new or existing DHCP service that you configure with Nimbus-specific
        MAC to IP mappings. This is generally simpler to set up and is covered in this guide.
    </li>
    <li>
        Local -- a DHCP server is installed on every VMM node and automatically configured
        with the appropriate addresses just before a VM boots. This is more complicated to
        set up initially but can be preferable in certain scenarios. It is however out of
        the scope of this guide. For details, see
        <a href="../reference.html#backend-config-invm-networking">this section</a> of the reference guide.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    To proceed, you need a DHCP server listening on the network(s) that will be available to
    virtual machines. You can use an existing site server or install your own. DHCP has great
    distribution support in Linux. In Debian/Ubuntu, the package is
    <tt class="literal">dhcp3-server</tt> while in Redhat it is <tt class="literal">dhcp</tt>.
</p>

<div class="note">
    <p class="note-title">DHCP caution</p>
    <p>
        You should be very careful when installing DHCP and ensure that you have permission
        from your network administrators to do so. Multiple DHCP services do not play nicely
        on the same subnet.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    When a VM is created using Nimbus, the service selects a network pool entry and sends
    the IP and hostname back to the client. It is the job of your DHCP server to ensure that
    the VM leases the correct IP address, otherwise the VM will not be able to access the
    network. You must add the correct MAC to IP mappings to your DHCP server configuration.
    To facilitate this, the Nimbus service produces several files for you.
</p>
<p>
    After you configure the network pool entries in the previous section, restart the service.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ nimbusctl services restart
</pre>
<p>
    Now take a look in <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/var/nimbus/</tt>. Among several
    other files, there should be these three:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <tt class="literal">dhcpd.entries</tt> - a generated list of host entries that can be
        included in your DHCP configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <tt class="literal">ip_macs.txt</tt> - a whitespace-separated list of IP address to
        MAC address pairings. If you have some unusual DHCP system, you can script parsing
        this file to generate your configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <tt class="literal">control.netsample.txt</tt> - a sample network pool entry, useful for
        testing out new VMM nodes. You will use this file in the next section.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    These files will only change when you alter your <tt class="literal">network-pools</tt>
    configuration and restart the service. So you can safely copy them to another system
    or use a script to generate your config. You only need to ensure that you keep things
    in sync whenever you change network pool entries. 
</p>
<p>
    The recommended configuration is to directly include the <tt class="literal">dhcpd.entries</tt>
    file in your <tt class="literal">dhcpd.conf</tt>. You can do this with the
    <tt class="literal">include</tt> directive:
</p>

<pre class="panel">
include "/path/to/dhcpd.entries";
</pre>

<p>
    On some systems, such as Ubuntu, you may need to copy the <tt class="literal">dhcpd.entries</tt>
    file to the DHCP configuration directory (<tt class="literal">/etc/dhcp3</tt>) as the daemon
    will not read from other locations.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively you can paste the contents of that file directly inline, or use a script to
    generate your needed configuration from the <tt class="literal">ip_macs.txt</tt>. Once
    the configuration is in place, restart the DHCP server and you should be ready for real
    virtual machines! Proceed to <a href="vmm-setup.html">Install VMM Software</a>.
