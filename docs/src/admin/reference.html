<h2>Cloud configuration overview _NAMELINK(cloud-overview)</h2>

<p>
    The cloud configuration is a particular configuration of Nimbus that allows the cloud-client to
    operate out of the box.  It is what is set up when you are done with the
    <a href="z2c/index.html">Zero To Cloud Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
    This overview section and subsequent reference sections give a more in-depth explanation of how
    it works in order to provide context for administrators running Nimbus in production that want to
    customize settings or understand things in a more "under the hood" way for security/networking reasons.
</p>

<p>
    <i>This is all information for <b>deployers</b> of the cloud configuration to learn about it and customize it.  This is
    <b>not necessary for cloud users</b> to read and understand.</i>  If you
    are a cloud user just looking to understand how to launch and manage VMs
    on an existing cloud, start with the <a href="../clouds/">clouds</a> pages.
</p>

<p>
    In the Nimbus 2.6 release the repository service (<a href="#cumulus">Cumulus</a>) and the IaaS services
    MUST be on the same node.  In future releases this restriction will
    be lifted.
</p>

<p>
    The server addresses must be directly reachable from the Internet
    or otherwise configured to deal with being NAT'd.  The IaaS services container can be setup for NAT or other port
    forwarding situations.  Cumulus should be NAT friendly so long as
    its listening port (default 8888) is forwarded through the NAT.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="../img/cloud-overview-rt.png" alt="workspace cloud configuration" />
</p>
<p>
    The diagram above depicts the basic setup.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A special workspace client called the "cloud-client" invokes operations
        on the Iaas services and Cumulus server.  A number of defaults are assumed which makes this work out of the box (these defaults will be discussed
        later).
    </li>
    <li>
        Files are transferred from the cloud-client to a client-specific
        storage system  on the repository node (manual or other types of
        S3 protocol
        based transfers are also possible for advanced users).
    </li>
    <li>
        The service invokes commands on the VMMs to trigger file transfers
        to/from the repository node, VM lifecycle events, and destruction/clean
        up.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the workspace state changes, the cloud-client will reflect this to
        the screen (and log files) and depending on the change might also take
        action in response.
    </li>
</ul>

    Working backwards from the user's <tt class="literal">cloud-client</tt> experience is a
    good way to understand how the service needs to be setup.
</p>

<p>
    Here is an abbreviated depiction of a simple user interaction with a cloud,
    to give you an idea if you've never used it.  This does not depict an
    image transfer to the repository node but that is similarly brief.

<a name="cloud-assumptions"> </a>
<h2>Cloud configuration assumptions and defaults _NAMELINK(cloud-assumptions)</h2>

<p>
    A number of things go into making the cloud client work out of the box,
    but it is in large part accomplished by giving the user a downloadable
    package with a number of default configurations.
</p>

<p>
    These defaults limit functionality options in some cases, but that is the
    idea: eliminate decisions that need to be made and set working defaults.
    There are avenues left open for experienced users to do more
    (for example, by overriding the defaults or even switching over to the
    regular workspace client).
</p>

<p>
    In the previous section, the first thing that probably stands out is that
    there are no contact addresses being entered on the command line.
</p>

<p>
    The service and repository URLs are derived from a properties file
    that is included in the toplevel "conf" directory of the cloud-client
    package.
</p>

<p class="indent">
    <b>Note</b>: How properties files and commandline overrides work is covered
    in a <a href="#cloud-properties">later section</a> in detail, it is all designed to be
    flexible under the covers.  If you don't want to follow the conventions
    laid out in this current "assumptions" section, it will be important to
    understand the later section to know how to change things for a good
    client package or properties file(s) that your users can use.  Continue
    reading this section first, though, to get the basic ideas.
</p>

<p>
    There are three main groups of assumptions and defaults.  The first is the
    contact and identity information of the workspace service
    (see above for configuration sample where this are specified).
    The other two groups make up the rest of this "Assumptions" section:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#cloud-personaldir">Deriving per-user repository directories</a></li>
    <li><a href="#cloud-runtime">Runtime assumptions</a></li>
</ul>


<a name="cloud-personaldir"> </a>
<h3>Deriving per-user repository directories _NAMELINK(cloud-personaldir)</h3>

<p>
    For Cumulus S3 based commands (like <i>--list</i>, <i>--delete</i>, and
    <i>--transfer</i>) the server to contact is based on the contact in
    the cloud properties file.  The s3id and s3 secret to authenticate with
    the Cumulus server is stored in the
    cloud properties file.
</p>

<p>
    When you transfer a local file, the target of the transfer is the same
    filename in your personal repository directory. When you refer to the name
    of a workspace to run, this name must correspond to a filename in your
    personal repository directory.
</p>

<p>
    We know where the repository comes from but how is that directory derived?
</p>

<p>
    There are two other components to derive the directory used: the configured
    <i>base bucket property</i> and the <i>user S3 ID</i>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The configured <i>base directory property</i>.  The default
        configuration for the base bucket on the repository node is
        "<b>Repo</b>".  This value can be changed in the cloud.properties
        file so long as it matches the particular clouds setup.  It is
        best to not alter this value.
    </li>
</ul>


<p class="indent">
    <i>
        There is a cloud-client option to input any name or local
        file path and see what the derived URL is.  See the --extrahelp
        description of the --print-file-URL option.
    </i>
</p>

<a name="cloud-runtime"> </a>
<h3>Runtime assumptions _NAMELINK(cloud-runtime)</h3>

<p>
    The second set of assumptions to cover is how a given image file is going
    to actually work.  There are many options that you can specify in regular
    workspace requests.  For example, the memory size, the number of network
    interfaces to construct, the pool name(s) to lease network addresses from,
    and the partition name the VM is expecting for the base partition.
</p>

<p>
    Some fixed assumptions are made:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>There can be only <b>one network interface</b></li>
    <li>The network interface <b>is expecting its address via DHCP</b></li>
    <li>
        There can be only <i>one partition file</i>, for the root partition,
        configured with an ext2/ext3 filesystem.  Other filesystems may not
        work correctly (this has to do with the cloud's default kernel as well
        as its ability to edit the image's files before boot).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The rest of the launch request is filled by default configurations,
    here they are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Request <b>3584</b> MB of memory (this is usually overriden)</li>
    <li>Request networking address from a pool named <b>public</b></li>
    <li>Mount the partition to <b>sda1</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cloud configuration, necessary configurations _NAMELINK(cloud-necessary)</h2>

<p>
    The previous section summed up the defaults and main assumptions.  Opting
    to follow these conventions in your cloud leads to these configuration
    conclusions:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Install the workspace service in
            <a href="../admin/reference.html#resource-pool-and-pilot">resource
            pool mode</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Configure an
            <a href="../admin/quickstart.html#networks">network</a>
            for addresses to lease from and call it "<b>public</b>".
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a <i>cloud.properties</i> file for your cloud with
            the values in this <a href="../examples/cloud.properties">example
            file</a> changed to reflect the correct URLs and identities.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is best to distribute a unique cloud.properties for each user with the Cumulus credentials in the file already, this is easily set up when using the nimbus-new-user program and the Nimbus web application.  See the <a href="#user-management">user management</a> section for details.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If you need to adjust the default memory request, add a line of
            text like so to the <i>cloud.properties</i> file you will
            distribute:  <b>vws.memory.request=256</b>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a <i>Repo</i> base bucket on the repository node.
            This should be done by the Nimbus installer.
        </p>
    </li>

</ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <i>../conf/cloud.properties</i> is set as the user properties file
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>../lib/globus</i> becomes the new GLOBUS_LOCATION (overriding
            anything previously set)
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>../lib/certs</i> is set as a directory to add to the trusted
            X509 certificate directories for identity validations (the client
            verifies it is talking to the right servers).  Adding the CA cert(s)
            of the workspace service certificates to this
            directory ensures that the user will not run into CA (trusted
            certificates) problems.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The cloud client program respects settings from <b>three</b> different
    places, listed here in the <b>order of precedence</b>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Commandline arguments</b> - If the client uses one of the
            optional flags listed in <i>./bin/cloud-client.sh --extrahelp</i>,
            these values are used.  Many things can be overriden this way,
            including the service contacts.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>User properties file</b> - An example of this is distributed with the cloud client.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that you can include different properties files and have your
            users switch between clouds using
            <i>./bin/cloud-client.sh --conf ./conf/some-file</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If no <i>--conf</i> argument is supplied, the default file
            <i>cloud.properties</i> needs to exist.  If you need to change
            this in your client distribution for cosmetic reasons, you can
            do so by editing the one relevant line at the top of
            <i>./bin/cloud-client.sh</i>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Embedded properties file</b> - A properties file lives inside
            the workspace client jar (which is installed into
            <i>lib/globus/lib/workspace_client.jar</i>).  This controls all
            the remaining configurations.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
    There are (intentionally) <b>no fallback settings</b> for many of the properties, they will be included in the cloud.properties file you give to a user:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>ssh.pubkey (Path to SSH public key to log in with)</li>
    <li>vws.factory (Host+port of Virtal Workspace Service)</li>
    <li>vws.factory.identity (Virtal Workspace Service X509 identity)</li>
    <li>vws.repository (Host+port of cumulus image repository)</li>
    <li>vws.repository.type=cumulus (currently cumulus is the only supported repository protocol</li>
    <li>vws.repository.canonicalid (The users canonical ID)</li>
    <li>vws.repository.s3id (The users S3 ID)</li>
    <li>vws.repository.s3key (The users S3 secret key)</li>
    <li>vws.repository.s3bucket (The bucket where the system stores images)</li>
    <li>vws.repository.s3basekey (The basename of all images in the bucket)</li>
</ul>


<p>
    These are the embedded properties that are shipped with the cloud client,
    they can also exist in the cloud properties files to override the defaults:
</p>

<pre>
# Default ms between polls
vws.poll.interval=2000

# Default client behavior is to poll, not use asynchronous notifications
vws.usenotifications=false

# Default memory request

<h2>User management _NAMELINK(user-management)</h2>


<p>
    In order to manage Nimbus user more easily a set of command line tools
    have been created.
</p>

<UL>
    <LI>nimbus-new-user</LI>
    <LI>nimbus-list-users</LI>
    <LI>nimbus-edit-user</LI>
    <LI>nimbus-remove-user</LI>
</UL>

<p>
All of the tools take as a single mandatory argument an email address, with
the slight exception of <i>nimbus-list-users</i>.  nimbus-list-users allows
an administrator to query for users on their systems therefore it takes
as an argument a query pattern.  For example, if you wanted to look up
all the users with email addresses at gmail.com you would run:
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ nimbus-list-users %@gmail.com
</pre>

<p>
All of the command line tools take the argument --help and further information
can be found there.  For didactic purposes an example of a common session in which a
new user is created, changes, listed and removed follows:

<h2>Enabling the EC2 SOAP frontend _NAMELINK(elastic)</h2>
<p>
    After installing, the EC2 query frontend should be immediately
    operational. However if you wish you use the SOAP frontend as well,
    you must make a few configuration changes. To begin, see the
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/elastic</tt>
    directory.  The <tt class="literal">elastic.conf</tt> file here specifies
    what the EC2 "instance type"
    allocations should translate to and what networks should be requested
    from the underlying workspace service when VM create requests are sent.
</p>

<p>
    By default, a Nimbus installation will enable this service:
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
https://10.20.0.1:8443/wsrf/services/ElasticNimbusService
</pre></div>

<p>
    But before the service will work, you must adjust a container configuration.
    This will account for some security related customs for EC2:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Secure message is used, but only on the request.  No secure message
            envelope is sent around EC2 responses, therefore EC2 clients do not
            expect such a response.  It relies on the fact that <b>https</b>
            is being used to protect responses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both integrity and encryption problems are relevant, be wary of any
            http endpoint being used with this protocol.  For example, you
            probably want to make sure that add-keypair private key
            responses are encrypted (!).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Also, adjusting the container configuration gets around a timestamp
            format incompatibility we discovered (the timestamp is normalized
            <i>after</i> the message envelope signature/integrity is confirmed).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    There is a sample container <i>server-config.wsdd</i> configuration
    to compare against

<h2>Configuring the EC2 Query frontend _NAMELINK(query)</h2>

<p>
The EC2 Query frontend supports the same operations as the SOAP frontend.
However, it does not run in the same container. It listens on HTTPS using Jetty.
Starting with Nimbus 2.4, the query frontend is enabled and listens on port 8444.
For instructions on changing this port, see the
<a href="#service-ports">service ports</a> section.
</p>

<p>
Configuration for the query frontend lives in the
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/query/query.conf</tt>
    file.
</p>

<p>
The Query interface does not rely on X509 certificates for security. Instead,
it uses a symmetric signature-based approach. Each user is assigned an access
identifier and secret key. These credentials are also maintained by the service.
Each request is "signed" by the client by generating a hash of parts of the
request and attaching them. The service performs this same signature process
and compares its result with the one included in the request.
</p>

<!-- mention any safeguards against replay attacks? -->

<p>
    There is support for creating query credentials in the nimbus-new-user program, for more information see the <a href="#user-management">user management</a> section.
</p>

<p>
    There is support for distributing query tokens
    via the <a href="../faq.html#nimbusweb">Nimbus Web</a> application.

<h2>Changing the network ports of Nimbus and Cumulus <span class="namelink"><a href="#service-ports">(#)</a></span>
</h2>
<p>
    The assorted Nimbus and Cumulus services use several network ports. Each is configured with sensible
    defaults, but you may change them if needed. Below are instructions for changing the port of each service.
</p>

<h3>Nimbus core services (default 8443)</h3>
<p>
    Edit <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/libexec/run-services.sh</tt> and change the
    <tt class="literal">PORT</tt> line to your desired port number. You must restart the service
    for changes to take effect.
</p>

<h3>Nimbus EC2 query frontend (default 8444)</h3>
<p>
    Edit <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/query/query.conf</tt> and
    adjust the <tt class="literal">https.port</tt> line. You must restart the service
    for changes to take effect.
</p>

<h3>Cumulus (default 8888)</h3>
<p>
    The configuration options for Cumulus can be found in
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/etc/cumulus.ini</tt>.
    Under the heading <tt class="literal">[cb]</tt> there is a <tt class="literal">port</tt>
    entry.  Change that value and restart Cumulus with the <tt class="literal">nimbusctl</tt>
    program.
</p>
<pre class="panel">
[cb]

installdir = &lt;nimbus home&gt;
port = 8888
hostname = &lt;hostname&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    <i>note:</i>
    If this change is made after you have distributed a cloud.properties
    file to users then you will need to instruct your cloud-client users
    to change the value <tt class="literal">vws.repository=&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</tt>
    in their local cloud.properties file.

</p>

<h3>Nimbus Context Broker REST frontend (default 8446</h3>
<p>
    The context broker also has a RESTful HTTP interface which listens on a separate port.
    You can disable or change the port of this interface in a configuration file:
    <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus-context-broker/jndi-config.xml</tt>.
    Parameters under the <tt class="literal">rest</tt> resource control this interface.
    Restart the service for changes to take effect.
</p>

<h3>Nimbus Web application (default 1443)</h3>
<p>
    When enabled, the web application listens by default on port 1443. This and other configuration
    options are location in the <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/web/nimbusweb.conf</tt>
    file. Changes to this file require a restart of the service.

<h2>Using the Nimbus Web interface <span class="namelink"><a href="#nimbusweb-usage">(#)</a></span>
</h2>

<p>
    The Nimbus web application provides basic facilities for distributing new X509 credentials, EC2 query tokens, and cloud.properties files to users.
    
</p>
<p>
    Previously this was a tedious process that was difficult to do in a secure way that was also user friendly. Nimbus Web allows an admin to upload credentials for a user and then send them a custom URL which invites them to create an account.
</p>
<p>
    Once the web application has been configured, you can start to use it with the nimbus-new-user program (see the help output, -W flag), which allows you to very quickly add a user to the system and get the URL to distribute in your welcome email.  The <a href="#user-management">user management</a> tools provide machine parsable output options that make it easy to incorporate into scripts as well (perhaps you would like to go further and create those emails entirely programmatically).
</p>
<p>
    To get started, log into the web interface as a superuser and go to the
    <i>Administrative Panel</i>. This page has a section for creating users
    as well as viewing pending and existing users.  The best way to do this is by using the nimbus-new-user tool, but this option is available for you to create accounts manually.
</p>

<p>
    If you go the manual route: fill in the appropriate fields and upload an X509 certificate and (passwordless) key for the user. Note that the application expects plain text files, so depending on your browser you may need to rename files to have a .txt extension before you can upload them. Once the new account is created, you will be provided with a custom URL. You must paste this URL into an email to the user along with usage instructions.
</p>

<p>
    When the user accesses the custom URL, they will be asked to create a password
    and login. Inside their account, they can download the certificate and key which
    were provided for them by the admin. Note that the design of the application attempts
    to maximize the security of the process, with several important features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>The URL token can only be successfully used once</b>. After a
        user creates a password and logs in, future attempts to access that URL will
        fail. This is to prevent someone from intercepting the URL and using it to
        access the user's credentials. If this happens, the real user will be unable
        to login and will (hopefully) contact the administrator immediately (there is a message urging them to do so).
    </li>
    <li>
        In the same spirit, <b>the URL token will expire</b> after a configurable number of
        hours (default: 12).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The user's X509 private key can be downloaded once and only once</b>.
        After this download occurs,
        the key will be deleted from the server altogether. In an ideal security system,
        no person or system will ever be in possession of a private key, except for the
        user/owner of the key itself. Because we don't follow this for the sake of usability,
        we attempt to minimize the time that the private key is in the web app database.
    </li>
    <li>
        When a URL token is accessed or a private key is downloaded, the time and IP address of
        this access is logged and displayed in the administrative panel. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The nimbus-new-user tool can create a custom cloud.properties file to use with your cloud.  This will have all the right configurations as well as the user's query credentials in the "vws.repository.s3id" and "vws.repository.s3key" fields for using Cumulus.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuring a different host certificate _NAMELINK(cert-pointing)</h2>

<p>
    The Nimbus installer creates a Certificate Authority which is used for
    (among other things) generating a host certificate for the various services.
    There are three files involved in your host certificate and they
    are all generated during the install by the <em>nimbus-configure</em> program.
    By default, these files are placed in "$NIMBUS_HOME/var/" but you can control
    their placement with properties in the "$NIMBUS_HOME/nimbus-setup.conf" file.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>hostcert.pem</b> - The host certificate.
        The certificate for the issuing CA must be in the Nimbus trusted-certs
        directory, in hashed format.
    </li>
    <li><b>hostkey.pem</b> - The private key. Must be unencrypted and readable
    by the Nimbus user.</li>
    <li><b>keystore.jks</b> - Some Nimbus services require this special Java
    Key Store format. The <em>nimbus-configure</em> program generates this
    file from the host cert and key. If you delete the file, it can
    be regenerated by running <em>nimbus-configure</em> again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    To use a custom host certificate, you can delete (or relocate)
    these three files, copy in your own hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem, and run
    <em>nimbus-configure</em>, which will generate the keystore.
</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title">CA Certs</p>
    It is important that the issuing CA cert is trusted by Nimbus (and any
    clients used to access the Nimbus services). This is done by placing the
    hashed form of the CA files in the trusted-certs directory, by default
    "$NIMBUS_HOME/var/ca/trusted-certs/". For example, these three files:
</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title">Cumulus https</p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>
    If you are using Cumulus with https you will need to point it at the
    correct certificates as well.  This is further explained 
    <a href="#cumulus-https">here.</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="screen"><pre>
3fc18087.0
3fc18087.r0
3fc18087.signing_policy
</pre></div>
<p>
    If you simply want to generate new host certificates using the Nimbus
    internal CA (perhaps using a different hostname), you can follow a
    similar procedure. Delete or relocate the hostcert.pem, hostkey.pem,
    and keystore.jks files and then run <em>nimbus-configure</em>. New
    files will be generated.
</p>

<p>
    You can also keep these files outside of the Nimbus install (for example if
    you use the same host certificate for multiple services on the same machine.
    Just edit the $NIMBUS_HOME/nimbus-setup.conf file and adjust the hostcert,
    hostkey, and keystore properties. Then run <em>nimbus-configure</em>. If these files
    do not exist, they will be created.

<h2>Configuring Nimbus basics manually without the auto-configuration program _NAMELINK(manual-nimbus-basics)</h2>

<p>
    What follows is the instructions for setting up a container as they existed
    before the auto-configuration program or the installer came into being (see
    <a href="quickstart.html#part-IIb">here</a> for
    information about the auto-configuration program).  We are leaving in the docs because it provides some insight, especially for administrators that are preparing programmatic node configurations for their clusters (using systems such as Chef).
</p>

<hr />


<h4>* Service hostname:</h4>
<p>
    Navigate to the workspace-service configuration directory:
</p>

_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
cd $NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END


<p>
    Edit the "ssh.conf" file:
</p>

_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
nano -w ssh.conf
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END


<p>
    Find this setting:
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
service.sshd.contact.string=REPLACE_WITH_SERVICE_NODE_HOSTNAME:22</pre>
</div>

<p>
    ... and replace the CAPS part with your service node hostname.  This
    hostname and port should be accessible from the VMM nodes.
</p>

<p>
    (The guide assumes you will have the same privileged account name on the
     service node and VMM nodes, but if not, this is where you would make the
     changes as you can read in the ssh.conf file comments).
</p>


<h4>* VMM names:</h4>

<p>
    See the <a href="#resource-pool">resource pool</a> section to learn how to add VMM names.
</p>

<a name="networks"> </a>
<h4>* Networks:</h4>
<p>
    Navigate to the workspace service networks directory:
</p>

_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
cd $NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/network-pools/
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

<p>
    The service is packaged with two sample network files, <i>public</i> and
    <i>private</i>.
</p>
<p>
    You can name these files anything you want.  The file names will be the
    names of the networks that are offered to clients.  It's a convention to
    provide "public" and "private" but these can be anything.  If you do change
    this, the cloud client configuration for what network(s) to request will
    need to be overriden in the cloud.properties file that you distribute to
    users.
</p>

<p>
    The <i>public</i> file has some comments in it.  Edit this file to have
    the one DNS line at the top and one network address to give out.  The
    subnet and network you choose should be something the VMM node can bridge
    to (there are some advanced configs to be able to do DHCP and bridge
    addresses for addresses that are foreign to the VMM, but this is not
    something addressed in this guide).
</p>

_EXAMPLE_CMD_BEGIN
nano -w public
_EXAMPLE_CMD_END

</div>

<p>
    It is possible to force specific MAC addresses for each IP address, see the file for syntax details.  Usually the service will pick these for you from a pool of MAC addresses starting with a prefix that is configured in the "$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/network.conf" file.

<h2>Resource pool and pilot configurations _NAMELINK(resource-pool-and-pilot)</h2>
<p>
    There are modules for two resource management strategies currently
    distributed with Nimbus: the default "resource pool" mode and the "pilot"
    mode.
</p>
<p>
    The "resource pool" mode is where the service has direct control of a pool
    of VMM nodes.  The service assumes it can start VMs 
</p>
<p>
	These are explained below.  To learn about backfill and spot instances, see
	<a href="#backfill-and-spot-instances">backfill and spot instances overview</a>
</p>
<p>
    The "pilot" mode is where the service makes a request to a cluster's
    Local Resource Management System (LRMS) such as PBS.  The VMMs are equipped
    to run regular jobs in domain 0.  But if pilot jobs are submitted, the nodes
    are secured for VM management for a certain time period by the workspace
    service.  If the LRM or
    administrator preempts/kills the pilot job earlier than expected, the VMM
    is no longer available to the workspace service. 
</p>
<p>
    The "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/<b>resource-locator-ACTIVE.xml</b>"
    file dictates what mode is in use (container restart required if this
    changes).  See the available
    "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/<b>resource-locator-*</b>" files.
</p>

<a name="resource-pool"> </a>
<h3>Resource pool _NAMELINK(resource-pool)</h3>
<p>
    This is the default, see the <a href="#resource-pool-and-pilot">overview</a>.
</p>


<p>
    In the <a href="z2c/index.html">Zero to Cloud Guide</a>, the configuration script that you interacted with at end of the <a href="z2c/ssh-setup.html">SSH Setup</a> section took care of configuring the workspace service with the first VMM to use.
</p>

<p>
    A cloud with one VMM is perfectly reasonable for a test setup, but when it comes time to offer resources to others for real use, we bet you might want to add a few more.  Maybe a few hundred more.
</p>

<p>
    As of Nimbus 2.6, it is possible to configure the running service dynamically.  You can interact with the scheduler and add and remove nodes on the fly.  The <tt class="literal">nimbus-nodes</tt> program is what you use to do this.
</p>

<p>
    Have a look at the help output:
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
cd $NIMBUS_HOME
./bin/nimbus-nodes -h</pre>
</div>

<p>
    The following example assumes you have homogenous nodes.  Each node has, let's say, 8GB RAM and you want to dedicate the nodes exclusively to hosting VMs.  Some RAM needs to be saved for the system (in Xen for example this is "domain 0" memory), so we decide to offer 7.5GB to VMs.  For RAM, there is no overcommit possible with Nimbus.
</p>

<div class="note">
<p class="note-title">nimbus-nodes needs a running service</p>
    If the service is not running, the nimbus-nodes program will fail to adjust anything.  Make sure the workspace service is running with "./bin/nimbusctl start".
</p>
</div>

<p>
    You can SSH to each node without password from the nimbus account, right?
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
service-node $ whoami
nimbus
service-node $ ssh nequals01</pre>
</div>

<div class="screen"><pre>
nequals01 $ ...</pre>
</div>

<p>
    The nodes in the cluster are named based on numbers, so for example "nequals01", "nequals02", etc.  This means we can construct the command with a for loop.
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
$ NODES="nequals01"
$ for n in `seq -w 2 10`; do NODES="$NODES,nequals$n"; done
$ echo $NODES
nequals01,nequals02,nequals03,nequals04,nequals05,nequals06,nequals07,nequals08,nequals09,nequals10
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    With the <tt class="literal">$NODES</tt> variable in hand, we can make the node-addition call.
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
$ ./bin/nimbus-nodes --add $NODES --memory 7680
</pre>
</div>

<p>
    At any time you can use the "--list" action to see what the current state of the pool is.
</p>

<p>
    There are several other options discussed in the <tt class="literal">nimbus-nodes -h</tt> text, we will highlight one of the most important ones here.
</p>

<p>
    If you ever want to disable a VMM, use the live-update feature.  After running the following command, no new VMs can be launched on the node.  Any current VMs, however, will continue running.  So this is a way to "drain" your nodes of work if there is maintenance coming up, etc.
</p>

<div class="screen"><pre>
$ ./bin/nimbus-nodes --update nequals08 --inactive
</pre>
</div>


<a name="pilot"> </a>
<h3>Pilot _NAMELINK(pilot)</h3>
<p>
    
</p>



<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The first step to switching to the pilot based infrastructure
            is to make sure you have at least one working node configured
            with workspace-control, following the instructions in this
            guide as if you were not going to use dynamically allocated
            VMMs via the pilot.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the only nodes available are in the LRM pool, it would be best
            to drain the jobs from one and take it offline while you confirm
            the setup.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Next, make sure that the system account the container is
            running in can submit jobs to the LRM.  For example, run
            <b>echo "/bin/true" | qsub</b>
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Next, decide how you would like to organize the cluster nodes,
            such that the request for time on the nodes from the workspace
            service in fact makes it end up with usable VMM nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if there are only a portion of nodes configured
            with Xen and workspace-control, you can set up a special node
            property (e.g. 'xen') or perhaps a septe queue or server.
            The service supports submitting jobs with node property
            requirements and also supports the full Torque/PBS
            '[queue][@server]' destination syntax if desired.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Copy the
            "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/<b>resource-locator-pilot.xml</b>"
            to
            "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/<b>resource-locator-ACTIVE.xml</b>"
        </p>

        <p>
            The configuration comments in "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/<b>pilot.conf</b>"
            should be self explanatory.  There are a few to highlight here
            (and note that advanced configs are in <b>resource-locator-ACTIVE.xml</b>).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    HTTP digest access authentication based notifications
                    is a mechanism for pilot notifications.  Each message
                    from a pilot process to the workspace service takes
                    on the order of 10ms on our current testbed which is
                    reasonable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <b>contactPort</b> setting is used
                    to control what port the embedded HTTP server listens
                    on.  It is also the contact URL passed to the pilot
                    program, an easy way to get this right is to use an
                    IP address rather than a hostname.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note the <b>accountsPath</b> setting.
                    Navigate to that file ("services/etc/nimbus/workspace_service/<b>pilot-authz.conf</b>"
                    by default) and change the shared secret to something
                    not dictionary based and 15 or more characters.
                    A script in that directory will produce suggestions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This port may be blocked off entirely from WAN access
                    via firewall if desired, only the pilot programs need
                    to connect to it.  If it is not blocked off, the use
                    of HTTP digest access authentication for connections
                    is still guarding access.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can configure only SSH for these
                    notifications as well as configure both and use SSH as
                    a fallback mechanism.
                    When used as a fallback mechanism, the pilot will try to
                    contact the HTTP server and if that fails will then
                    attempt to use SSH.  Those message are written to a
                    file and will be read when the workspace service
                    recovers.  This is an advanced configuration, setting
                    up the infrastructure without this configured is recommended
                    for the first pass (reduce your misconfiguration chances).
                </p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The <b>maxMB</b> setting is used to
                    set a hard maximum memory allotment across all workspace
                    requests (no matter what the authorization layers
                    allow).  This a "fail fast" setting, making sure
                    dubious requests are not sent to the LRM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To arrive at that number, you must arrive at the
                    maximum amount of memory
                    to give domain 0 in non-hosting mode.  This should be
                    as much as possible and you will also configure this later
                    into the pilot program settings (the pilot will make sure domain
                    0 gets this memory back when returning the node from hosting
                    mode to normal job mode).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the node boots and xend is first run, you should
                    configure things such that domain 0 is already at this
                    memory setting.  This way, it will be ready to give
                    jobs as many resources as possible from its initial
                    boot state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Domain 0's memory is set in the boot pmeters.
                    On the "kernel" line you can add a parameter like this:
                    <b>dom0_mem=2007M</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If it is too high you will make the node unbootable,
                    2007M is an example from a 2048M node and was arrived
                    at experimentally.  We are working on ways to
                    automatically figure out the highest number
                    this can be without causing boot issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take this setting and subtract at least 128M from it,
                    allocating the rest for guest workspaces.  Let's label
                    128M in this example as <b>dom0-min</b>
                    and 2007 as <b>dom0-max</b>.  Some memory
                    is necessary for domain 0 to at least do privileged
                    disk and net I/O for guest domains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These two memory setting will be configured into the
                    pilot to make sure domain 0 is always in the correct
                    state.  Domain 0's memory will never be set below the
                    <b>dom0-min</b> setting and will always
                    be returned to the <b>dom0-max</b> when
                    the pilot program vacates the node.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of letting the workspace request fail on the
                    backend just before instantiation, the
                    <b>maxMB</b> setting is configured in
                    the service so b requests for more memory will be
                    rejected up front.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So [ <b>dom0-max</b> minus
                    <b>dom0-min</b> equals
                    <b>maxMB</b> ].  And again
                    <b>maxMB</b> is the maximum allowed for
                    guest workspaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ( You could make it smaller.  But it would not make
                    sense to make it bigger than
                    [ <b>dom0-max</b> minus
                    <b>dom0-min</b> ] because this will
                    cause the pilot program itself to reject the request. )
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The <b>pilotPath</b> setting must be
                    gotten right and double checked.
                    See
                    <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5869">this
                    bugzilla item</a>
                </p>
            </li>

        </ul>

    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Next, note your pilotPath setting and put a copy of
            <b>workspacepilot.py</b> there. Run
            <b>chmod +x</b> on it and that is all
            that should be necessary for the installation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Python 2.3 or higher (though not Python 3.x) is also required
            but this was required for workspace-control as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            A sudo rule to the xm program is also required but this was
            configured when you set up workspace-control.  If the account
            the pilot jobs are run under is different than the account that
            runs workspace-control, copy the xm sudo rule for the account.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            Open the <b>workspacepilot.py</b> file in an
            editor.  These things must be configured correctly and require
            your intervention (i.e., the software cannot guess at them):
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>
                Search for "<b>secret: pw_here</b>" around
                line 80.  Replace "pw_here" with the shared secret you
                configured above.
            </li>

            <li>
                Below that, set the "minmem" setting to the value you chose
                above that we called <b>dom0-min</b>.
            </li>

            <li>
                Set the "dom0_mem" setting to the value you chose above
                that we called <b>dom0-max</b>.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            The other configurations should be explained enough in the
            comments and they also usually do not need to be altered.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might like to create a directory for the pilot's logfiles
            instead
            of the default setting of "/tmp" for the "logfiledir"
            configuration.  You might also wish to septe out the config
            file from the program.  The easiest way to do that is
            to configure the service to call a shell script instead of
            workspacepiloy.py.  This in turn could wrap the call to the
            pilot program, for example:
            <b>"/opt/workspacepilot.py -p /etc/workspace-pilot.conf $@"</b>
        </p>

    </li>

    <li>
        Now restart the GT container and submit test workspace requests as
        usual (cloud requests work too).
    </li>

<h2>Network configuration details _NAMELINK(backend-config-invm-networking)</h2>
<p>
    While addresses for VMs are configured and chosen within the Nimbus service,
    they are physically queried via an external DHCPd service. There are two ways
    of arranging the DHCP configuration.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Centralized -- a new or existing DHCP service that you configure with Nimbus-specific
        MAC to IP mappings. This is generally simpler to set up and is covered in the
        <a href="z2c/networking-setup.html">Zero-to-Cloud guide</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Local -- a DHCP server is installed on every VMM node and automatically configured
        with the appropriate addresses just before a VM boots. This is more complicated to
        set up initially but can be preferable in certain scenarios.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Because Nimbus chooses the MAC address, it controls which DHCP entry will be
    retrieved by the VM. Additionally, ebtables rules are configured to ensure that
    a malicious or misconfigured VM cannot use another MAC or IP.
</p>

<p>
    In a local DHCP scenario, <tt class="literal">workspace-control</tt>  on each VMM
    manages the DHCP configuration file and injects entries just before each VM boots.
    To prevent DHCP broadcast requests from getting out to the LAN, an ebtables rule is
    enacted to force packets to a specific local interface.
</p>

<p>
    Configuring local DHCP is not difficult, but you should exercise caution to
    ensure that the DHCP daemons on each VMM do not interfere with other networks.
    First of all, you must install an ISC-compatible DHCP server. This should be
    available on all Linux distributions.
</p>
<p>
    Once installed, find the DHCP configuration location. Typically this is something
    like <tt class="literal">/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</tt> or
    <tt class="literal">/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf</tt>. Replace this file with the example
    in the workspace-control package:
    <tt class="literal">share/workspace-control/dhcp.conf.example</tt> and then edit
    it to include proper subnet declarations for your network. Afterwards, try
    restarting DHCP and checking logs to ensure that it started without error.
</p>
<p>
    Next, edit the <tt class="literal">networks.conf</tt> file in
    <tt class="literal">etc/workspace-control/</tt>. Set the
    <tt class="literal">localdhcp</tt> option to <tt class="literal">true</tt>
    and take a look at the <tt class="literal">dhcp-bridges</tt> section to configure
    where DHCP packets are bridged to.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, you may need to edit the sudo script that workspace-control uses to
    alter <tt class="literal">dhcp.conf</tt> and restart the service. This script
    is located at <tt class="literal">libexec/workspace-control/dhcp-config.sh</tt>.
    It expects the following defaults:
</p>

<pre class="panel">
# Policy file for script to adjust
DHCPD_CONF="/etc/dhcpd.conf"

# Command to run before policy adjustment
DHCPD_STOP="/etc/init.d/dhcpd stop"

# Command to run after policy adjustment
DHCPD_START="/etc/init.d/dhcpd start"
</pre>

<p>
    You should also ensure that this script can be called via sudo as the
    <tt class="literal">nimbus</tt> user.
</p>

<a name="context-broker-standalone"> </a>
<h2>Configuring a standalone context broker _NAMELINK(context-broker)</h2>

<p>
    The <a href="../faq.html#ctxbroker">context broker</a> is used to
    facilitate <a href="../clouds/clusters.html">one click clusters</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The context broker
    is installed and configured automatically starting with Nimbus 2.4, but there
    is not a dependency on any Nimbus service component.  It can run by itself in a
    GT container.  You can use it for deploying virtual clusters on EC2 for
    example without any other Nimbus service running (the cloud client #11 has
    an "ec2script" option that will allow you to do this).
</p>
<p>
    If you want to install the broker separately from Nimbus, download the 
    Nimbus source tarball, extract it, and run 
    <i>scripts/gt/broker-build-and-install.sh</i> with an appropriate 
    <b>$GLOBUS_LOCATION</b> set.
</p>
<p>
    To set up a standalone broker that is compatible with post-010 cloud clients,
    follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Create a passwordless CA certificate.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can do this from an existing CA.  To unencrypt an RSA key, run:
            <i>openssl rsa -in cakey.pem -out cakey-unencrypted.pem</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can use the CA created by the Nimbus installer
            under $NIMBUS_HOME/var/ca
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Make very sure that the CA certificate and key files are read-only
            and private to the container running account.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add the CA certificate to your container's trusted certificates
            directory.  The context broker (running in the container) creates
            short term credentials on the fly for the VMs.  The VMs use this
            to contact the broker: the container needs to be able to verify
            who is calling.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
           Navigate to "<i>$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus-context-broker</i>"
           and adjust the "caCertPath" and "caKeyPath" parameters in the
           "<i>jndi-config.xml</i>" file to point to the CA certificate
            and key files you created in previous steps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the old and new context brokers can both use the same
            CA certificate and key file.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Container restart is required.
        </p>

<h2>Cumulus _NAMELINK(cumulus)</h2>
<p>
    <a href="../faq.html#cumulus">Cumulus</a> is the S3 compliant repository 
    management service for Nimbus.
</p>
<p>
Cumulus is an open source implementation of the Amazon S3 REST API.  It
is packaged with the Nimbus
however it can be used without nimbus as well.  Cumulus allows
you to server files to users via a known and adopted REST API. Your
clients will be able to access your data service with the
Amazon S3 clients they already use.

</p>

<a name="cumulus-config"> </a>
<h3>Cumulus Configuration _NAMELINK(cumulus-config)</h3>
<p>
When the Cumulus server is run it expects to find a configuration file (typically
called cumulus.ini) in one or all of the following locations:
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>/etc/nimbus/cumulus.ini</li>
        <li>~/.nimbus/cumulus.ini</li>
        <li>the same directory from which the program was launched</li>
        <li>file pointed to by the environment variable CUMULUS_SETTINGS_FILE</li>
    </ol>
<div class="note">
<p class="note-title">cumulus.ini in Nimbus</p>
For Nimbus installations this file can be found at
<tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/etc/cumulus.ini</tt>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Each file in the path is read in (provided it exists).  The values found 
in each file override the values found in the previous file in this list.

</p>


<a name="repository-location"> </a>
<h3>Repository Location _NAMELINK(repository-location)</h3>
<p>
The backend storage system in Cumulus has been created with a modular 
interface that will allow us to add more
sophisticated plugins in the future.  Thus giving the administrator 
many powerful options.
In the current implementation there is a single storage module which stores 
user files a mounted file system.  
The reliability and performance of Cumulus will thus be
limited by the reliability and performance of that file system.  Because
of this Cumulus administrators will often want to specify a location for
the repository.
</p>
<p>
Within the cumulus.ini file there is the [posix]:directory directive.
This is the directory in which all of the files in the Cumulus repository
will be stored.  The names of the files in that directory will be
obfuscated based on the bucket/key name.  In order to discover what file
belongs to what bucket/key you must use the user management tools (included
with the Cumulus installation)
There are a series of tools under the bin
directory which start with nimbusauthz-* that can help with this.  In most
cases there will be no need for a system administrator to use these
tools and they are provided for expert usage for problematic situations.
</p>

<a name="boto"> </a>
<h3>Using the boto client _NAMELINK(boto)</h3>
<p>
To use boto it is important to disable virtual host based buckets and
to point the client at the right server.  here is example code that
will instantiate a boto S3Connection for use with CB:
</p>
<pre class="panel">
    cf = OrdinaryCallingFormat()
    hostname = "somehost.com"
    conn = S3Connection(id, pw, host=hostname, port=80, is_secure=False, calling_format=cf)
</pre>

<a name="s3cmd"> </a>
<h3>Using the s3cmd client _NAMELINK(s3cmd)</h3>
<p>
Once you have the s3cmd successfully installed and configured you must
modify the file: $HOME/.s3cfg in order to direct it at this server.
Make sure the following key value pairs reflect the following changes:
</p>
<pre class="panel">
    access_key = &lt;access id&gt;
    secret_key = &lt;access secret&gt;
    host_base = &lt;hostname of service&gt;
    host_bucket = &lt;hostname of server&gt;
    use_https = False
</pre>
<a name="cumulus-https"> </a>
<h3>Using HTTPS with Cumulus _NAMELINK(cumulus-https)</h3>
<p>
In order to use a secure https connection with cumulus you must edit the 
cumulus.ini file and provide it with a certificate and key pair.  In
a typical nimbus installation these are generated for you and placed at:

<tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/var/hostcert.pem</tt>
<tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/var/hostkey.pem</tt>

To add them to the cumulus.ini file add the following lines:
<pre class="panel">
[https]
enabled=True
key=/home/nimbus/var/hostkey.pem
cert=/home/nimbus/var/hostcert.pem
</pre>

<a name="cumulus-quotas"> </a>
<h3>Disk Usage Quotas _NAMELINK(cumulus-quotas)</h3>
<p>
Cumulus allows administrators to set disk space limits on a per user basis.
By default users are created with unlimited space.  To set a disk quota 
limit use the program <tt class="literal">NIMBUS_HOME/ve/bin/cumulus-quota</tt>
Here is an example that will set the user user1@nimbusproject.org to a 
100 byte limit:
</p>
<pre class="panel">
$ ./ve/bin/cumulus-quota user1@nimbusproject.org 100
$ ./ve/bin/cumulus-list-users user1@nimbusproject.org
friendly        : user1@nimbusproject.org
ID              : Ar2yXcfdhImjMNeWGUHJZ
password        : ddOWFSC5rol9L6Tk14hA0QeS7valQdy38xeVvkFZwq
quota           : 100
canonical id    : 21161ebe-862a-11df-a9ca-001de0a80259
</pre>

<a name="cumulusnimbusconfig"> </a>
<h3>Configuring Cumulus Options in Nimbus _NAMELINK(cumulusnimbusconfig)</h3>

<p>

There are a few variables that Nimbus relies on to find information 
about its co-located Cumulus server.  These variables are found in
the file: 
<tt class="literal">./services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/cumulus.conf</tt>.
They are normally written automatically by the nimbus-configure program 
but if an administrator makes some manual changes to their Nimbus installation
some of these variables may been to be changed as well.

<ul>
    <li><tt class="literal">cumulus.authz.db</tt></li>
    The cumulus authz database.  By default it is an sqlite database and
    is located at $NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/etc/authz.db

    <li><tt class="literal">cumulus.repo.dir</tt></li>
    The location of the cumulus posix backend file repository.  By default
    this is $NIMBUS_HOME/cumulus/posixdata.  Quite often users will want
    to change this to a more favorable location.  Likely one with more
    disk space or faster disks.

    <li><tt class="literal">cumulus.repo.bucket</tt></li>
    The cumulus bucket in which all cloud client images are stored.

    <li><tt class="literal">cumulus.repo.prefix</tt></li>
    The prefix iwith which all image names are prepended.

</ul>

<a name="lantorrent"> </a>
<h2>LANTorrent _NAMELINK(lantorrent)</h2>
<p>
    <a href="../faq.html#lantorrent">LANTorrent</a> is fast multicast file
distribution protocol designed to saturate all the links in a switch.  
There are several optimizations planned for future releases of LANTorrent.
</p>
<p>
LANTorrent works best for the following scenarios:
    <ol>
        <li>large file transfers (VM images are typically measured in gigabytes)</li>
        <li>local area switched network (typical for data center computer racks)</li>
        <li>file recipients are willing peers.</li>
            Unlike other peer to peer transfer protocol, bittorrent for 
            example, LANTorrent is not designed with leeches in mind.  It
            is designed under the assumption that every peer is a willing
            and able participant.
        <li>many endpoints request the same file at roughly the same time</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<a name="lantorrent-protocol"> </a>
<h3>LANTorrent Protocol _NAMELINK(lantorrent-protocol)</h3>
<p>
When an endpoint wants a file it submits a request to a central agent.
This agent aggregates request for files so that they can be sent out in
an efficient single multi-cast session.  Each request for a source file
is stored until either N request on that file have been made or N'
seconds have passed since the last request on that source file has been
made.  This allows for a user to request a single file in several
unrelated session yet still have the file transfered in an efficient
multi-cast session.
</p>
<p>
Once N requests for a given source file have been made or N' seconds
have passed the destination set for the source file is determined.  A
chain of destination endpoints is formed such that each node receives
from and sends to one other node.  The first node receives from the
repository and send to a peer node, that peer node sends to another,
and so on until all receive the file.  In this way all links of the
switch are utilized to send directly to another endpoint in the switch.
This results in the most efficient transfer on a LAN switched network.
</p>
<p>
Often times in a IaaS system a single network endpoint (VMM) will want
multiple copies of the same file.  Each file is booted as a virtual
machine and that virtual machine will make distinct changes to that file
as it runs, thus it needs it own copy of the file.  However that file
does not need to be transfered across the network more than once.
LANTorrent will send the file to each endpoint once and instruct that
endpoint to write it to multiple files if needed.
</p>


<a name="lantorrent-config"> </a>
<h3>LANTorrent Configuration _NAMELINK(lantorrent-config)</h3>
<p>
LANTorrent is not enabled in a default Nimbus installation.  A few 
additional steps are required to enable it.
</p>
<p>
The following software is required on both service and VMM nodes:
    <ol>
        <li>Python 2.5+ (but not Python 3.x)</li>
        <li>Python <tt class="literal">simplejson</tt> module</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
Lantorrent is run out of <tt class="literal">xinetd</tt> thus it must also be installed on all VMMs.
</p>

<p>
To install LANTorrent you must take the following steps:

<ol>
<li>
    <p>
        Edit <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/nimbus-setup.conf</tt> and enable LANTorrent:
    </p>
    <pre class="panel">lantorrent.enabled: True</pre>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        Edit <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/common.conf</tt>
        and change the value of <tt class="literal">propagate.extraargs</tt>:
    </p>
    <pre class="panel">propagate.extraargs=$NIMBUS_HOME/lantorrent/bin/lt-request.sh</pre>

    <p>
    Be sure to expand <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME</tt> to its full and actual path.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p>Install LANTorrent on VMM</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy lantorrent to the VMM nodes</li>
            From the source distribution of Nimbus copy the lantorrent
            directory to all VMM nodes.  
        <li>optional: You may want to setup a python virtual environment for the installation</li>
            To do this, run <tt class="literal">virtualenv /path_to_install_lantorrent</tt>.
            Then, use the <tt class="literal">/path_to_install_lantorrent/bin/python</tt> binary instead of your system python.
        <li>optional: If you don't have Internet connectivity on the VMM, you
        will have to manually install the simplejson library from source (in the
        virtual env if you chose to create one).</li>
        <li>Run <tt class="literal">python setup-vmm.py install</tt> on each node.
            This will output the xinetd file that you will need to install
            into <tt class="literal">/etc/xinetd.d</tt>.  Note the <i>user</i> value in the output:
            this should be the same user as your workspace control user.
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>
    <p>Install LANTorrent into xinetd</p>
    <p>
    The <tt class="literal">setup-vmm.py</tt> script outputs the need xinetd <tt class="literal">lantorrent</tt> file.  For example:
    <pre class="panel">
    ============== START WITH THE NEXT LINE ==================
    service lantorrent
    {
        type        = UNLISTED
        disable     = no

        protocol    = tcp
        user        = bresnaha
        wait        = no
        port        = 2893
        server      = /home/bresnaha/lt1/bin/ltserver

    =============== END WITH THE PREVIOUS LINE =================
    </pre>
    This output must be copied into <tt class="literal">/etc/xinetd.d/lantorrent</tt>.  Once done,
    restart xinetd.
    </p>
     <pre class="panel">
     # /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
     </pre>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Change the propagation method.</p>
    <p>Edit the file:
        <tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/authz-callout-ACTIVE.xml</tt>
        and change:
    </p>
    <pre class="panel">&lt;property name="repoScheme" value="scp" /&gt;</pre>
    to:
    <pre class="panel">&lt;property name="repoScheme" value="lantorrent" /&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>Restart the service:
<pre class="panel">
$ $NIMBUS_HOME/bin/nimbusctl restart
</pre>
</li>

<li>
    <p>
        [optional] If the path to nimbus on the workspace-control nodes (VMMs)
    is not <tt class="literal">/opt/nimbus</tt> you will also need to edit a configuration file on
    all backend nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the file: <tt class="literal">&lt;workspace-control path&gt;/etc/workspace-control/propagation.conf</tt>
    Adjust the value of:

    <pre class="panel">
    lantorrentexe: /opt/nimbus/bin/ltclient.sh
    </pre>

    <p>to point to the proper location of your <tt class="literal">ltclient.sh</tt> script.  This should
    be a simple matter of changing <tt class="literal">/opt/nimbus</tt> to the path where you chose
    to install workspace control.

<a name="backfill-and-spot-instances"> </a>
<h2>Backfill and Spot Instances _NAMELINK(backfill-and-spot-instances)</h2>
<p>
    Backfill and Spot Instances are two related features, they both deal with
    <i>asynchronous</i> instance requests, requests that may only be started
    at appropriate times, if ever.
</p>
<p>
	Spot instances are requested by remote users with a particular bid
	(represented in Nimbus as a discount applied to minutes charged to your
	account).  Users may consult the spot price history before bidding.  If the
	bid is accepted (equal or higher to the current spot price), the instances
	are started.  They may be stopped at a moment's notice. The implementation
	is of EC2's 2010-08-31 WSDL, see the 
	<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/">Amazon EC2 Spot
	Instances</a> guide for more background.
</p>
<p>
	Backfill is a mechanism that the <i>administrator</i> configures to keep
	idle resources busy. You pick a particular VM image that will be launched
	when the nodes would otherwise be idle.  This works nicely with systems
	such as <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/">Condor</a> that can
	gracefully deal with being preempted.
</p>
<p>
    To jump to the precise semantics and configurations that are possible, see
    the comments in the 
    <a href="https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/blob/HEAD/service/service/java/source/etc/workspace-service/async.conf">async.conf</a>
    file.
</p>
<p>
    To start using spot instances as a user, follow the
    <a href="../elclients.html#spot">spot instance user's guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
    To begin with backfill, read over the above conf file first.  Choose a
    current administrator account to launch the image from or create one with
    the "--dn" flag like so:
</p>

<div class="screen">
<b>$</b> ./bin/nimbus-new-user --dn BACKFILL-SUPERUSER backfill@localhost<br>
</div>

<p>
    ... where "BACKFILL-SUPERUSER" is the user configured in async.conf (that
    is the default value).
</p>
<p>
    Backfill responds <i>immediately</i> to changes in the resource pool like
    the presence of higher priority requests (which includes spot instances if
    they are configured, as well as regular requests of course).  This also
    includes when the resource pool is fundamentally changed by the
    <tt class="literal">nimbus-nodes</tt> program.  When you add and remove
    nodes, you are changing the overall capacity which is a critical piece
    of information for mapping asynchronous requests like backfill and spot
    instances.
</p>
<p>
    A ramifications of that is that, since adding nodes is always done when the service is running, having backfill enabled while you make adjustments might
    get in your way during this period.  It can be easier to disable backfill,
    make node adjustments, and then re-enable backfill.  This applies especially
    to <i>removing</i> nodes since the <tt class="literal">nimbus-nodes</tt> 
    program does not allow nodes to be removed that have instances running on
    them.
</p>
<p>
    This could be said for spot instances as well.  It is slightly trickier with
    spot instances because they are remote user requests and you may not want to
    disable things abruptly for people.  But on the other hand, they are spot
    instances so they should be able to deal with sudden terminations.
</p>
<p>
    Another thing to watch out for is using the "max.instances=0" configuration.
    Zero means as many as possible, but this maximum number is only calculated
    at service startup time.  So if you add a bunch of new nodes to the resource
    pool and the backfill instances do not immediately start consuming them
    greedily, this is what is happening.  After adding all those nodes, stop and
    then start the service and the backfill configuration will recalibrate.

<h2>libvirt template and virtio</h2>
<p>
The submission of VMs to the hypervisor (with Xen or KVM) is done by Nimbus
via libvirt.  Then submitting to libvirt the VM run request is described
in an xml file.  This file has many potential customizations depending on
the feature set supported by a particular VMM.  Many of the values are 
dynamically determined by Nimbus, however a site admin may want to add their
own custom optimizations.
</p>
<p>
The xml used for every VM submission is generated from a template found
in the workspace control installation at:
<tt class="literal">
/etc/workspace-control/libvirt_template.xml
</tt>
Admins can add site specific optimizations (like virtio) to this template.

<h2>Copy Propagation _NAMELINK(cpprop)</h2>
<p>
Copy propagation is a very simple mechanism for getting a virtual machine 
image out of Cumulus and coping it to the VMM for use as a VM instance.
To use this mechanism all VMMs must have shared disk space with the 
Cumulus repository.  In situations where users have a file system shared 
among all nodes in the Nimbus setup boot times can be significantly reduced
with the cp propagation driver.
</p>

<a name="cpprop-config"> </a>
<h3>Copy Propagation Configuration _NAMELINK(cpprop-config)</h3>
<p>
In order to enable copy propagation you must edit the file 
<tt class="literal">$NIMBUS_HOME/services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/other/authz-callout-ACTIVE.xml</tt>
        and change:
    <pre class="panel">&lt;property name="repoScheme" value="scp" /&gt;</pre>
    to:
    <pre class="panel">&lt;property name="repoScheme" value="cp" /&gt;</pre>

</p>
<a name="#cpprop-passthrough"> </a>
<h3>Copy Propagation Pass Through _NAMELINK(cpprop-passthrough)</h3>
<p>
It is possible to use copy propagation as a <i>pass through</i> propagation
adapter.  This means that instead of only being able to boot files in the Cumulus 
repository an administrator can allow users to specify any file on the 
file system to which the VMM node's nimbus user has access.
</p>
<p>
<B>WARNING: This should NOT be enabled in most cases due to security
implications</b>.
<BR>
When using the copy propagation pass through adapter the Cumulus security
ACL authz protection is entirely bypassed.  A user can boot and copy
any image that the <i>nimbus</i> user can read.  This should be used with
extreme care and only on cloud with nothing but completely trusted users.
</p>


<a name="imagecache"> </a>
<h2>Image Cache _NAMELINK(imagecache)</h2>
<p>
Image propagation is the process of sending a VM image from the Cumulus 
repository to the VMM which boots that image for the user.  This can be 
a time consuming part of the boot process.  Often times the same image is
booted multiple times on the same VMM.  In order to prevent that image from
having to be repeatedly propagated we introduced an image cache to the 
workspace control software.  
</p>
<p>
When a user uploads an image to the Cumulus repository its md5 sum is 
calculated and kept as metadata with that image.  Then when a user launches 
that VM image, first its md5 sum is sent to the selected VMM.  That VMM
checks its cache to see if it has a matching image.  If a match is found 
the cached image is used.  If not the image is propagated to that VMM
and added to its cache keyed by its md5 sum.
</p>
<a name="imagecache-config"> </a>
<h3>Image Cache Configuration _NAMELINK(imagecache-config)</h3>
<p>
Each VMM that will have a cache enabled must alter this file:
<tt class="literal">/opt/nimbus/etc/workspace-control/images.conf</tt>.
Search for the two values 
<tt class="literal">cachedir:</tt> 
<tt class="literal">cache_size:</tt>
<i>cachedir</i> is the path to the image cache and <i>cache_size</i> is 
the maximum size of the cache.  When these values are enabled the cache
will be in effect.

<h2>Nimbus Administration _NAMELINK(nimbusadministration)</h2>
<p>
The Nimbus administration tools, nimbus-admin and nimbus-nodes, allow
administrators to configure VMMs and monitor the VMs running on them.
The nimbus-nodes tool is used for configuring the VMM
nodes available to the service. It allows you to list,
add, update and remove nodes on the service. 
The nimbus-admin tool allows you to monitor and shut down the virtual machines
running on the service. 
</p>

<a name="nimbus-admin"> </a>
<h3>Nimbus Admin _NAMELINK(nimbus-admin)</h3>
<p>
The nimbus-admin tool, is in the $NIMBUS_HOME/bin directory.
You can view the nimbus-admin help with:
<pre class="panel">
$ nimbus-admin --help
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<b>List:</b><br />
The --list command will display a list of virtual machines with the
following information:<br />
<b>id:</b> the VM id number<br />
<b>node:</b> the physical VMM node the VM is running on<br />
<b>group_id:</b> the group id number associated with the VM<br />

<b>--gid (-g)</b> filter VMs by group id<br />
<b>--gname (-gn)</b> filter VMs by group name<br />
<b>--host (-hn)</b> filter VMs running on a particular VMM host<br />
<br />
As an example, let's list by host:<br />
<div class="screen"><pre>
$ ./nimbus-admin --list --host worker02.example.org
id         :  4
node       :  worker02.example.org

</pre></div>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Shutdown:</b><br />
The --shutdown command destroys specified virtual machines.
When shutting down a VM, a soft shutdown is called first, which puts
the VM in "propagated" mode. Once the VM is propagated, it is then
fully destroyed. You can specify which VMs to shutdown in the following ways:<br />
<b>--all (-a)</b> shutdown all running VMs on service<br />
<b>--id (-i)</b> shutdown VM by VM id<br />
<b>--user (-u)</b> shutdown VM by user display name<br />
<b>--dn (-d)</b> shutdown VM by user DN name<br />
<b>--gid (-g)</b> shutdown VM by group id<br />
<b>--gname (-gn)</b> shutdown VM by group name<br />
<b>--host (-hn)</b> shutdown all VMs with specified host<br />
<b>--seconds (-s)</b> amount of time to wait for VMs to shutdown to
                      propagation mode before being trashed. If
                      seconds option not specified, default is a
                      maximum of 30 seconds
<br /><br />
Example:
<div class="screen"><pre>
$ nimbus-admin --shutdown --all
</pre></div>
<br /><br />
The --shutdown command also allows you to shutdown a list of VMs at once
by using a comma-separated list.<br />
Example: 
<div class="screen"><pre>
./nimbus-admin --shutdown --id 3,4,5,6,10,13
</pre></div>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Nodes:</b><br />
The --nodes command shows a list of all the VMM nodes running on the
service with a list of VM ids each one is running.
Example:
<div class="screen"><pre>
./nimbus-admin --nodes
node1: 3,4,5
node2: 1,2,6
</pre></div>
</p>

<h3>Nimbus Nodes _NAMELINK(nimbus-nodes)</h3>
<p>
To start using the nimbus-nodes tool first go to your nimbus home
directory. $NIMBUS_HOME/bin where you will find the script
nimbus-nodes. Run ./nimbus-nodes --help to see the help file which
lists all available commands.
</p>
<p>
<b>List:</b><br />
The --list command of nimbus-nodes lists all the VMM nodes running
on the service. You can also input a comma separated list of VMMs
to list if you want to specify which VMMs you want to see. The
list function outputs the following information about each node:
<br /><br />
<b>hostname:</b>the VMM node name<br />
<b>pool:</b>Resource pool name for this node<br />

Value of * means all available networks<br />
<b>in_use:</b>whether or not this node is being used<br />
<b>active:</b>whether or not this node is currently running<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Add:</b><br />
The --add (-a) HOSTS command adds the specified VMM nodes to the
pool. Node paramets can be specified as additional arguments and
if no parameter is specified a default will be read from the
config file.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update:</b><br />
The --update (-u) HOSTS command updates the configuration values
of VMM nodes. At least one node parameter must be specified as
an additional argument. 
</p>
<p>
<b>VMM Node Parameters</b><br />
The following node parameters can be used as additional arguments
for the --add and --update commands. 
<br /><br />
<b>--active (-A)</b> Allow VMM nodes to take on new virtual machines.
Default for new nodes.<br />
<b>--inactive (-i)</b> Prevent VMM nodes from accepting new VMs.
This will not terminate any already running VMs.<br />
<b>--memory (-m)</b> Maximum memory available on node for VMs<br />
<b>--networks (-n)</b> List of networks associated with a node.
A value of * means all available networks<br />
<b>--pool (-p)</b> Resource pool name for this VMM node<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Remove</b><br />
The --remove (-d) command removes VMM nodes from the nimbus resource 
pool. In use nodes cannot be removed.

<p>
<b>Network Pool Allocation</b><br />
The --allocation (-N) command provides network pool allocation
information. Outputs the following information for each pool
entry: hostname, ip, mac address, broadcast, subnet mask, gateway,
in_use, explicit mac.<br /><br />
This command also has three optional commands.<br/>
<b>--pool</b> allows you to enter a pool name and only displays
entries from that pool<br />
<b>--free</b> displays only entries that are not in_use<br />
<b>--used</b> displays only entries that are in_use<br />
