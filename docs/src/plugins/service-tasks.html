<h2>VMM control tasks</h2>

<h4>* Summary:</h4>
<p>
    There is an internal module of the
    <a href="../faq.html#workspace-service">workspace service</a>
    that governs what tasks are launched when a particular action is
    required.  For example, when the service engine determines that a
    "Start" action is required, a particular implementation of a
    "WorkspaceTask" is launched, keyed by the type of action.  This "Start"
    action task may be defined as something that does not call workspace-control
    anymore, for example.
</p>

<p>
    You can exploit this layer of indirection by creating your own task set
    that does anything you want at the different points in the VM lifecycle
    (or perhaps does something simultaneously).
</p>

<h4>* Classes:</h4>

<p>
    See the <i>org.globus.workspace.xen.xenssh</i> package and the
    <i>org.globus.workspace.service.impls.async</i> package (for example,
    the RequestFactoryImpl class).
</p>
<p>
    (This one is more hands on than the other plugins)
