<h2>Download the cloud client _NAMELINK(download)</h2>

<p>
  In order to use the client you will need to have Java (1.5+) installed
  on your system.
</p>

<p>
  Note that using the cloud client requires access to a Nimbus cloud. If you are
  a member of the academic community, you can gain access to one of several
  <a href="http://www.scienceclouds.org/">science clouds</a>. You may also apply
    for an account on a <a href="http://www.futuregrid.org">FutureGrid</a> Nimbus cloud.
</p>

<p>
    Download the
    <a href="_NIMBUS_WEBSITE/downloads/nimbus-cloud-client-019.tar.gz">latest
    Nimbus cloud client</a> from the <a href="_NIMBUS_WEBSITE/downloads/">downloads page</a>,
    untar the file, and change to the cloud client directory.
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ wget _NIMBUS_WEBSITE/downloads/nimbus-cloud-client-019.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf nimbus-cloud-client-019.tar.gz
$ cd nimbus-cloud-client-019/
</pre>

<p> 
    Congratulations -- you are now the happy owner of a brand new cloud client!
    At any time, get help like so:
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --help
</pre>
<p>
    Make sure to subscribe to <i>workspace-user@globus.org</i> (see the
    <a href="_NIMBUS_WEBSITE/contact.html">contact</a> page for instruction on how
    to subscribe) to hear about client version updates.
</p>

<br />

<a name="configure"> </a>
<h2>Configure and prepare for deployment _NAMELINK(configure)</h2>

<p>
    You will need credentials for the cloud you are accessing. These should be given to you by the cloud provider. 
</p>

<p>Test the security setup:</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --security
</pre>

<p>
    Issues? See the <a href="#help">help resources</a> for help.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Not enabled on a cloud yet?</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
    You need to look at the instructions published for each cloud.  Many clouds will give you access
    and provide you with the proper credentials and <tt class="literal">cloud.properties</tt> file.
</p>

<p class="note">
    For clouds running the newest versions of Nimbus (2.5+ with the Cumulus image repository),
    you will need to have the image repository credentials in your <tt class="literal">cloud.properties</tt> file and you
    will need to use cloud client #16 or later.  The administrator should have provided you with this file.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Does your cloud require VPN?</i>
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Some clouds require the use of virtual private networks. Check the
    configuration notes for the cloud you want to use and if private
    networks are required first follow the
    <a href="appendix.html#vpn">VPN installation steps</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Configure cloud and SSH public key:</i>
</p>
<div class="indent">
    <p>
        The default client
        configuration should handle your initial needs.
	</p>
	<p>
		You might want to change things in
        the <tt class="literal">conf/cloud.properties</tt> file, <b>probably not</b>.
    </p>
	<p>
		Most of the time a configuration file tailored to the cloud
		you want to use should have been made available to you from
		the administrator or cloud website.
	</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                You can point the client at the cloud you will be using by
                redefining the specific service and repository endpoints (obtain
                them from the cloud administrator).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                You can set up an alternate location of the ssh public key that you
                want to put on the VM.  This will allow you to log in after launching.
                The default is what you'd want usually, <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</i>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Note that you can override options via commandline if desired
                (see the <tt class="literal">--extrahelp</tt> option)
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you do nothing (a highly recommended and undervalued course
        of action) these things will be picked up from default locations
        specified in the file.
    </p>

<br />

<a name="vm"> </a>
<h2>Pick a virtual machine image to deploy _NAMELINK(vm)</h2>

<p>
    In order to deploy a VM with custom configuration you need to
    upload an image to the cloud. To make it easy for you we already
    uploaded many images to your personal repository directory that you
    can launch. You can find more detailed descriptions of those images
    at the <a href="_SCIENCECLOUDS_WEBSITE/marketplace/">Nimbus
    marketplace</a>. To see what is available for running, list the images as
    follows:
<p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --list
</pre>
<p>
    If you are feeling adventurous you could also create an image yourself
    and upload them to the cloud, see this
    <a href="appendix.html#transferring">appendix entry</a>.  You may as well
    explore that capability later if this is your first time using the cloud
    (in order to just get a feel for the cloud client).
</p>

<br />
        
<a name="run"> </a>
<h2>Deploy a workspace _NAMELINK(run)</h2>

<p>
    To launch, use the <tt class="literal">--run</tt> option of the client. There are
    two required run options: (1) <tt class="literal">--name</tt> defines the name of
    an image and (2) <tt class="literal">--hours</tt> specifies the number of hours for
    which the image will be deployed. For example, if you want to run
    the image in your personal repository called "hello-cloud" for 1 hour,
    run the following command:
</p>
  
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --run --name hello-cloud --hours 1
</pre>

<p>
If successful, the run command should produce roughly this output:
</p>
  
<pre class="panel">
SSH public keyfile contained tilde:
  - '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub' --> '/home/guest/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'

Launching workspace.

Using workspace factory endpoint:
    https://cloudurl.edu:8443/wsrf/services/WorkspaceFactoryService

Creating workspace "vm-023"... done.

       IP address: 123.123.123.123
         Hostname: ahostname.cloudurl.edu
       Start time: Fri Feb 29 09:36:39 CST 2008
    Shutdown time: Fri Feb 29 10:36:39 CST 2008
 Termination time: Fri Feb 29 10:46:39 CST 2008

Waiting for updates.

State changed: Running

Running: 'vm-023'
</pre>

<p>
    The output prints out the endpoint information of the Nimbus service
    associated with the cloud you are using.  This is followed by information
    about the deployed VM which includes: the name you will use to
    terminate the VM, the instantiation/termination times, and the
    contact information for the workspace.
</p>

<div class="note">
    Note that the information printed contains the network address
    for the VM.  <i>You will need this in order to log in.</i>
</div>

<br />
        
<a name="interact"> </a>
<h2>Interact with a workspace _NAMELINK(interact)</h2>

<p>
    Recall that your public key has been configured in the
    <tt class="literal">conf/cloud.properties</tt> file. At launch time,
    the public key file was installed to <tt class="literal">/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt>
    on the VM image, so that after it boots you should be able to log
    in by typing:
</p>
        
<pre class="panel">
$ ssh <b>root</b>@ahostname.cloudurl.edu
</pre>

<p>
    Make sure that you log in to the <b>root account</b> -- that's the
    only one that gets set up with the key. You can create and
    configure other accounts once you log in.
</p>

<p>
    Another useful tip:
    if you don't want SSH to remember the generated host key in the
    known-hosts file (and complain when this name is taken by a
    different VM later), use SSH with the
    option "<tt class="literal">-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no</tt>"
    (<a href="clusters.html#secgap">later</a> you will learn how to be more secure)
</p>


<br />
    
<a name="query"> </a>
<h2>Querying a workspace _NAMELINK(query)</h2>

<p>
    Should you ever find yourself somewhat out of touch with your
    VMs there is an easy way to reestablish relations:
</p>
  
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --status --handle vm-023
</pre>

<p>
    If you don't recall what the handle you need is, there are running
    logs of each run kept in the <tt class="literal">history</tt> directory.  The highest numbered
    subdirectory name in the history directory is probably a good guess.
</p>

<br />
        
<a name="saving"> </a>
<h2>Saving workspace changes _NAMELINK(saving)</h2>

<p>
    You can save a template image's changes after use, this command will
    shutdown the workspace and send the altered file back to your personal
    repository directory. 
</p>

<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --save --handle vm-023 --newname custom-1
</pre>

<p>
    Note that without the <tt class="literal">--newname</tt> parameter this will
    <b>overwrite the source file</b>.  If you do not have permissions
    to overwrite the source file (for example, you are using the
    pre-populated template images that are provided), you must use the
    <tt class="literal">--newname</tt> parameter which is kind of like the "save as" option
    for documents in a word processor.
</p>
<p>
    Failing to do so will cause a permissions error and you will lose
    the changes on that run.  If you uploaded the image personally, you
    will have the permissions to overwrite the source file (i.e., the
    ability to use the <tt class="literal">--save</tt> option without also using
    <tt class="literal">--newname</tt>).
</p>

<p>
    As explained in the <a href="#query">query</a> section above, if you
    do not know the handle you need, have a look in the history directory.
</p>

<br />
        
<a name="terminate"> </a>
<h2>Terminate a workspace _NAMELINK(terminate)</h2>

<p>
    All good things come to an end. So it is with workspaces which
    come to an end in the following way:
</p>
  
<pre class="panel">
$ ./bin/cloud-client.sh --terminate --handle vm-023
</pre>

<p>
    As explained in the <a href="#query">query</a> section above, if you
    do not know the handle you need, have a look in the history directory.
</p>

<br />
        
<a name="advanced"> </a>
<h2>Advanced Topics _NAMELINK(advanced)</h2>
<p>
    You have now earned your stripes: you have deployed a VM (or two) and
    got a taste for cloud computing. How do we now move on to something
    useful? One of the most commonly voiced requirements is to be able to
    deploy "one-click virtual clusters" -- see <a href="clusters.html">our
    guide to deploying virtual clusters</a> to learn more.
</p>

<p>
  Also, you can find information on miscellaneous topics in the 
  <a href="appendix.html">Cloud Client Appendix</a> 
</p>

<br />
        
<a name="help"> </a>
<h2>Help resources _NAMELINK(help)</h2>

<p>
  For questions (and to see others' questions answered), make sure to subscribe
  to <i>workspace-user@globus.org</i> (see the 
  <a href="_NIMBUS_WEBSITE/contact.html">contact</a> page for instruction on how to
  subscribe).
</p>

<p>
  For help with security issues, you should also inquire to the list.  Before
  doing so, note that the cloud-client has a <tt class="literal">--security</tt> flag for a basic
  trust check.  And other programs under the "bin" directory have their own
  help system, for example if you run "<i>./bin/grid-proxy-init.sh -help</i>" 
  this may solve a problem your having right away.
</p>

<p>
  For problems you'd like to keep quiet about (for example security with
  specific IP adresses etc.), you should email your administrator contact
  privately.
</p>

<hr />

<p>Troubleshooting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  
    <p>
      <b>Problem:</b> grid-proxy-init reports that it cannot find your
      credential's certificate authority (CA) files.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You may be using a credential that was only recently trusted by the 
      cloud.  In this case, add the CA certificate to the "lib/certs" 
      directory which is where "./bin/grid-proxy-init.sh" looks for CA
      certificates.
    </p>
  
  </li>
</ul>
