<i>2.8 - Summary</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            This release contains many important bug fixes as well as some new features.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
Propagation by means of a file system copy: this can greatly decrease the boot time of VMs on systems where a fast shared file system exists.  
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
VM image caching: this will greatly increase the boot performance for clouds with a base image that is launched often (a common use case).  This works with any propagation method.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            libvirt template support added.  A cloud administrator can
            now completely control the options sent to libvirt when starting
            a virtual machine by editing the template file
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            ImportKeyPair is implemented in the EC2 protocols (details below).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<i>2.8 - IaaS Services</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
        Internally the Nimbus team has introduced a build and test system
        with <a href="http://build.nimbusproject.org">Jenkins</a>.
            This has helped us create a more robust and
        well tested system as well as making it easier for the community
        to make contributions.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Nimbus Context Broker has been factored out into a separate tarball install
            in addition to being part of the default IaaS installation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implemented EC2 ImportKeyPair operation. The old CreateKeyPair behavior is disabled (the behavior of allowing a "||" token based import mechanism with CreateKeyPair).
        </p>
        <p>
            EC2 used to only have CreateKeyPair, now the EC2 protocols in Nimbus IaaS use ImportKeyPair and CreateKeyPair as intended as operations.  The old behavior can be enabled if the administrator wants.  (<a href="https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus/issues/36">enhancement 36</a>).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Documentation added to the <a href="http://www.nimbusproject.org/docs/latest/admin/z2c/">zero to cloud guide</a> describing
            how to setup Nimbus to work with KVM.
        </p>

<i>2.8 - Control Agents</i>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            libvirt template support added.  A cloud administrator can
            now completely control the options sent to libvirt when starting
            a virtual machine by editing the template file
            <tt class="literal">/opt/nimbus/etc/workspace-control/libvirt_template.xml</tt>
            on the VMM nodes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        A cache of propagated images can now be kept on each VMM.  Before
        an image is propagated the cache is checked for an image with a
        matching checksum.  If found that image is used and no propagation
        is needed which can save a significant amount of time.  This will
        work with any propagation mechanism.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        The cp (copy) propagation driver has been introduced in this release.
        This prepares an image for use by a VMM by copying it directly out
        of the Cumulus data store and into a temporary location from which it
        will be booted.  For users with shared fast file systems this can
        bring great performance benefits.

<i>2.7 - Summary</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for backfill and spot VM instances was introduced. Backfill instances are configured by the
            administrator and automatically start on idle resources. When user requests are received, backfill
            instances are preempted and terminated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spot instances are similar to backfill, but are initiated by the user. Users may "bid" on VM slots and
            compete for available resources. Like backfill, spot instances can be preempted and terminated at any
            time. Preemption occurs when either a real (non-spot) request or a spot request with a higher bid is
            received and no other resources are available.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The EC2 Query interface has substantially improved compatibility with EC2 clients. The generated XML
            is now largely identical.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Idempotent instance creation is now supported, via the EC2 interfaces.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There are also numerous bug fixes and minor enhancements.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<i>2.7 - IaaS Services</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for backfill and spot VM instances was introduced.
            See the <a href="admin/reference.html#backfill-and-spot-instances">documentation</a> for more information.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>

            Idempotent instance creation is now supported, via the EC2 interfaces.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The metadata server now supports listening on multiple network interfaces. The URL provided to
            VMs can be configured based on the requested networks.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The EC2 Query interface has substantially improved compatibility with EC2 clients. The generated XML
            is now largely identical. The name space version in responses matches the request version
            regardless of the actual version. Additionally, version 1 signatures are now supported, to enable
            some clients that never updated to version 2.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <tt class="literal">scripts/check-dependencies.sh</tt> program has been added to the services
            installer to help detect dependency problems before starting the installation process.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added support for specifying multiple CPU architectures in <tt class="literal">vmm.conf</tt>. Detailed in

<i>2.6 - Summary</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            This is the first release of LANTorrent, a fast multicast file distribution protocol designed to saturate all the links in a switch.  This works best for situations with a local area network, large files, and many cooperative peers that need the same file -- i.e., it is geared towards IaaS image propagation (but could work in other scenarios).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Dynamic VMM configuration management is now possible with the new <tt class="literal">nimbus-nodes</tt> program.  This allows you to adjust the resource pool while the service is still running, adding and removing resources on the fly.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The context broker has a new client-side HTTP/REST interface in addition to WSRF. Users authenticate with the same tokens they use for Cumulus and the Elastic Query API.  This opens up the context broker for several new client integrations including ones using alternate languages.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Cumulus now supports the S3 COPY operation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            A new upgrade tool is introduced, <tt class="literal">install-from</tt>.  This assists with updating a previous Nimbus installations (2.5 and higher).  It currently requires that the old Nimbus services are all stopped and no VMs are deployed.

            <tt class="literal">nimbus-public-image</tt> is a new program that allows administrators to register VM images in the local Cumulus repository that will be usable for all users of the system (but of course only stored once on disk).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            As usual, some bug fixes and minor enhancements.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<i>2.6 - Installer</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>install-from program</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            A new upgrade tool is introduced, this assists with updating a previous Nimbus installations (2.5 and higher).  It currently requires that the old Nimbus services are all stopped and no VMs are deployed.
        </p>
        <p>
            You use this program instead of the regular <tt class="literal">install</tt> instructions.  Most of the installation process is exactly as normal, but <tt class="literal">install-from</tt> will base most of the initial configurations on your old installation.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not yet entirely Magic&trade; so you will need to follow the instructions in the <a href="admin/upgrading.html">upgrade guide</a> to make it happen.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<i>2.6 - IaaS Services</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>nimbus-nodes program</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Dynamic VMM configuration management is now possible with the new <tt class="literal">nimbus-nodes</tt> program.  This allows you to adjust the resource pool while the service is still running, adding and removing resources on the fly.
        </p>
        <p>
            For information and instructions, see <a href="admin/reference.html#resource-pool">this section</a> of the administrator guide.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>nimbus-import-users</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a new program that allows multiple cloud installations to coordinate user information with each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can "dump" user information into a text file and this allows you to import it elsewhere.  This allows administrators (or larger groups) to coordinate users across clusters/installations.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is compatible with the <tt class="literal">nimbus-list-users</tt> tool, you can for example run things like <tt class="literal">ssh nimbus@othercloud nimbus-list-users % | nimbus-import-users</tt>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>nimbus-public-image</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a new program that allows administrators to register VM images in the local Cumulus repository that will be usable for all users of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are read-only images that all Nimbus users will see as an option in their "--list" output for running.
        </p>
        <p>
            To save these images as new, derivative templates, the user would need to run "--save --new-name" and create a new object.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>Passthrough configuration</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            When an image file URL scheme is not the normal "cumulus://", previously the service would always pass this along to the VMM to interpret on its own.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you can explicitly set what propagation to use for "cumulus://" and what passthrough schemes are allowed (if any).

        </p>

            operation allows you to duplicate an object stored in the system without having to do any data transfer to your client machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was tested with <tt class="literal">s3cmd</tt> and <tt class="literal">boto</tt>.  Future cloud-client versions could use this more natively for image duplication/rename.
        </p>

            <i>Redirection</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to make Cumulus a scalable service we added a feature
            which takes advantage of the temporary redirection in error in
            the
            <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/index.html">Amazon S3 Protocol</a>.  A Cumulus administrator can create a text file 
            full of cloned Cumulus server contact strings.  A maximum number
            of allowed connected clients is associated with each replicated
            Cumulus server.  If, after a client connects and authenticates,
            that number is exceeded, then a <i>301 Temporary Redirect</i>
            error is return to the client instructing it to try a different
            Cumulus server.

        <p>
            Minor changes were made to the service to allow an admin to 
            configure Cumulus so that it will use postgres instead of the
            default SQLite DB.

<i>2.6 - LANTorrent</i>
<ul>

        <p>
            <i>Introducing LANTorrent!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the first release of LANTorrent, a fast multicast file distribution protocol designed to saturate all the links in a switch.
        </p>
        <p>
            This works best for situations with a local area network, large files, and many cooperative peers that need the same file -- i.e., it is geared towards IaaS image propagation (but could work in other scenarios).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is disabled by default and takes extra steps to activate.  See
            <a href="admin/reference.html#lantorrent">this section</a> of
            the administrator's guide for instructions as well as
            <a href="admin/reference.html#lantorrent-protocol">detailed explanations</a> of how it works.

<i>2.6 - Context Broker</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>HTTP/REST support</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The context broker has a new client-side HTTP/REST interface in addition to WSRF. Users authenticate with the same tokens they use for Cumulus and the Elastic Query API.  This opens up the context broker for several new client integrations including ones using alternate languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example there is a 
            <a href="http://github.com/nimbusproject/Nimboss">prototype
            client api</a> being built that integrates with the REST broker.

<i>2.5 - Summary</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>We are happy to announce the first version of Cumulus!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cumulus is a storage cloud implementation compatible with the Amazon Web Services S3 REST API (with small exceptions), it works seamlessly with S3 clients such as s3cmd, jets3t, and boto.  In addition, it offers extra functionality such as disk quota enforcement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Cumulus replaces the current GridFTP-based upload and download of VM images: it integrates tightly in a Nimbus installation as the VM image repository solution.  And it can be also installed on its own to manage a storage cloud: a Nimbus IaaS installation needs Cumulus but not vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
            Read more below in the Cumulus section of the changelog.

            <i>Zero To Cloud installation process</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides being the first Cumulus release, the other major event of 2.5 is the first release of the "Zero To Cloud" installation process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the new programs and enhancements in this release work together with the goal of providing a seamless installation process.  Read more in the changelog below about each new feature, highlights include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                A new user management system: users can be added and managed quickly.  Their credentials are created on the fly (but there is still an alternative path for coexistence with your own credential system).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                All of the new user management tools include a machine parsable mode that makes them easy to incorporate into your own scripts.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                Tight user integration with Cumulus: user management includes user setup with the image repository as well as the IaaS services.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                Tight integration between the user management tools and the web application.  This allows administrators to add a user and instantly receive the secure URL that the new user will visit to pick up his credentials and cloud.properties file.
                </p>

                No unix account separation or root account needed for Cumulus -- installation is easier because the IaaS central services and Cumulus can live in the same, non-root unix account.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                The IaaS services are able to consult information in a database about files the remote user wants to launch.  When the "outside" namespace of the file is Cumulus based, there is a translation to an "inside" location and mechanism.  This technique is now used to encapsulate propagation mechanisms, allowing for an easy way to introduce new and faster methods. 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            All of this combined to allow us to, among other things, provide a new installation process for Nimbus.  You can now tend to the central service node installation separately and very quickly.  Further, you install in a "fake" mode that doesn't actually invoke hypervisor machines yet.  Doing all of this allows you to know that the central services are configured and working (including security), leaving VMM related matters to be tackled separately.

            <i>Integration with a central, site DHCPd</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of hosting a private DHPCd for each VMM, Nimbus now supports (by default) editing a lease file for a central DHCPd on the LAN. This makes it easier to install and integrate with existing infrastructure.  The old method is supported as an advanced configuration.  Details below in the IaaS Services and workspace-control sections.

            <i>New scheduling options</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            When using the default scheduler, the VMM selection process is now more configurable:
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a <i>round-robin</i> configuration that looks for available nodes with the highest percentage of free RAM.  And a <i>greedy</i> configuration that looks for available nodes with the lowest percentage of free RAM.  Details below.

            <i>New options for pilot based scheduling</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The pilot module now sends more information to the local resource manager (such as Torque).  This is for accounting and potentially authorization purposes, you can now more easily track remote users and more information about the launch via the resource manager itself.

        <p>
            <i>New alternative propagation methods</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two new contributed propagation drivers for getting VM images to the hypervisor nodes: HTTP and HDFS.  These are for use outside of the cloud client currently, and you need to configure Nimbus to allow for non-Cumulus-based image locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are for use on sites where the remote user knows more about image locations than the Cumulus name for it.  The HTTP driver is also good for having a central image repository (you can specify trusted hosts to pull from).

        <p>
            <i>Better performing blankspace: physical partition leases</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to support very large temporary space partitions for VMs, and fast access to them, Nimbus now allows you to configure a list of physical partitions to lease out to incoming Nimbus VMs on each node (formatted for each use).

            <i>A new user management system</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The tight integration with Cumulus and a new authorization database have resulted in a way to create a cohesive "user system" for Nimbus clouds that allows the administrator to quickly add, delete, and edit users.  In $NIMBUS_HOME/bin, you will find several new programs, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>nimbus-new-user</li>
            <li>nimbus-edit-user</li>
            <li>nimbus-list-users</li>
            <li>nimbus-remove-user</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these commands work well from the terminal but also include options to make it easy to do a wide array of tasks from scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of the EC2 Query protocol, the credentials are no longer checked against a text file full of keys: they now integrate with these tools, it is all database driven.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to continue supporting X509 certificates, a map file is still populated with certificate names ("DN"s), but these new commandline utilities should be the thing editing those files in order to keep them in sync.  You should use these tools for all user management now.

            The nimbus-new-user program is a particular highlight, it replaces the "cloud-admin.sh" program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right out of the box you can use this to generate new users.  It will produce a X509 certificate/key, query ID/key (for use with Cumulus and EC2 Query interfaces), and the cloud.properties file that the user should use.  It allows you to specify the set of authorization/credits rules to apply.  It also integrates with the Nimbus web application if you choose: it will produce a special single-use URL that you can email to new users to pick up the newly created credentials and the user-specific <i>cloud.properties</i> file.

            The <i>nimbus-version</i> program allows you to examine/remember
            the details of your installation.  A metadata file is inserted by
            the release builder which records things like the exact version,

            from.

        </p>
        <p>
            Once you configure the web application (it is not enabled by default), nimbus-new-user can automatically set up a pickup URL for new users.  This is a short-lived, obscure URL that you can share with new users to pickup their new credentials (this can be for either X509 or query tokens or both).
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the nimbus-new-user tool can be put into a machine parsable mode, the URL can be incorporated programmatically into a script you write to send a welcome email.

        <p>
            When using the default scheduler, the VMM selection can now happen in one of two ways, driven by configuration:
        </p>
        <p>
            1. A <i>round-robin</i> configuration in resource-locator-ACTIVE.xml (this is the default  mode).  This looks for matching nodes (enough space to run, appropriate  network support, etc.) with the highest percentage of free RAM.  If  there are many equally free nodes it will pick randomly from those.  As  should be clear, this favors entirely empty nodes first.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. A <i>greedy</i> configuration in resource-locator-ACTIVE.xml.  This looks for matching  nodes (enough space to run, appropriate network support, etc.) with the lowest percentage of free RAM.  If there are many equally unfree nodes it will pick randomly from those.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Extra account information: the pilot module adds "-A /remote/user/dn" to the submission which allows administrators to use this information for accounting purposes.  The "-A" flag is part of the PBS standard and it is up to the implementation/configuration to ignore the information or do something with it such as accounting.

            <i>Integration with site DHCPd</i>

        <p>
            Instead of hosting a private DHPCd for each VMM, Nimbus now supports (by default) editing a lease file for a central DHCPd on the LAN. This makes it easier for many administrators to integrate with existing infrastructure (and in most cases speeds up the installation).
        </p>
        <p> 
            You will configure the DHCP server to respond to specific MAC addresses with specific IP addresses.  Each time you change your network pool in Nimbus, you must update the DHCPd at the same time with the new information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old method of having a DHCPd run on each VMM is still supported as an advanced configuration.

<i>2.5 - Cumulus</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>We are happy to announce the first version of Cumulus!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cumulus is a storage cloud implementation compatible with the Amazon Web Services S3 REST API (with small exceptions), it works seamlessy with S3 clients such as s3cmd, jets3t, and boto.  In addition, it offers extra functionality such as disk quota enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cumulus replaces the current GridFTP-based upload and download of VM images: it integrates tightly in a Nimbus installation as the VM image repository solution.  And it can be also installed on its own to manage a storage cloud: a Nimbus IaaS installation needs Cumulus but not vice versa.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>Cumulus requirements</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cumulus requires Python 2.5+ (but not 3.x) with SQLite support [1] and gcc [2] on the central service node.
        </p>
        <p>
            [1] - SQLite should be included by default in any Python 2.5 installation but we've run into some distributions removing that.
        </p>
        <p>
            [2] - gcc is not strictly required if you install packages to your Python site-packages: pyOpenSSL and Twisted 8.2+.  Otherwise the installer will do some Python->C bridge code compilation to get dependencies enabled.  The service installer does not run as root (and nothing on the service node needs root anymore), so in the case where you use gcc like this, those dependencies will be installed inside a virtual Python environment just for Cumulus code.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>Support for quotas</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cumulus allows administrators to set disk space limits on a per user basis. By default users are created with unlimited space. See the <a href="admin/reference.html#cumulus-quotas">quota documentation</a> for more information.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>GridFTP is not used with this release</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cumulus is used instead.  The impact this will have on current cloud users is discussed in the <a href="http://lists.globus.org/pipermail/workspace-announce/2010-June/000020.html">email introducing Cumulus</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Cumulus will fall under the same best-effort support policy as other Nimbus components.  As always, using the mailing lists is advised since you will get an opportunity for help from the community (this does happen and it is great to see).

            <i>DHPCd changes</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, workspace-control is now configured to use an off-node DHCPd server.  That server should be configured according to instructions using the <a href="admin/z2c/index.html">Zero To Cloud Guide</a>.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            In order to enable the old method of having a DHCPd run on each VMM, you need to carry out the advanced "localdhcp" configurations described in workspace-control's "etc/workspace-control/networks.conf" file.

            <i>New alternative propagation methods</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The contributed HTTP and HDFS propagation drivers currently integrate without the propagation namespace awareness: normally in the cloud configuration, remote users will specify a "cumulus://" URL which is translated to an internal propagation location and mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
           They are for use on sites where the remote user knows more about image locations than the Cumulus name for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            These alternative propagation methods need to be manually enabled, consult workspace-control's "etc/workspace-control/propagation.conf" file.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>HTTP propagation driver</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The HTTP driver is good for having a central image repository on the internet for image files, using this you will not need to get changes to images back to each cloud's repository.  
       </p>
        <p> 
            Enable via workspace-control's "etc/workspace-control/propagation.conf" file.  And you can specify  trusted hosts to pull from, see the central Nimbus node's "services/etc/nimbus/workspace-service/global-policies.conf" file

        <p>
            The HDFS propagation driver is good for sites experimenting with fast propagation techniques.  It requires a local HDFS installation as well as an installation of the client tools on each VMM.  See workspace-control's "etc/workspace-control/propagation.conf" file.

            <i>Better performing blankspace: physical partition leases</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to support very large temporary space partitions for VMs, and fast access to them, Nimbus now allows you to configure a list of physical partitions to lease out to incoming Nimbus VMs on each node.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an non-default and preliminary feature.
        </p>
        <p>
            The partition will be presented to a configured "/dev" device inside every Nimbus VM that is started on the VMM node.  If there is a conflict with a mountpoint that the user's request contains, the administrator has a choice of rejecting the request or not providing the blankspace.
        </p>

                    New propagation-only mode for workspace-control that helps
                    with development and testing of fast/smart propagation
                    techniques.  Does not require libvirt or any sudo
                    privileges to work with the central Nimbus service and
                    fully exercise propagation.

<i>2.5 - Cloud Client</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>Nimbus 2.5 requires the newest cloud client</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The current cloud client as of this release is cloud-client-016. The 2.5 service release will <b>not</b> work with previous cloud clients.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <i>Backwards compatible</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Cloud client 16 introduces Cumulus support using the S3 library jets3t.  In order to maintain backwards compatibility, it is still compatible with older clouds that use GridFTP.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new, default repository behavior is triggered when "vws.repository.type=cumulus" is present in the cloud.properties file.  This is a value that any Nimbus 2.5+ cloud should distribute in their cloud.properties file (start with the <a href="admin/z2c/index.html">Zero To Cloud Guide</a> to learn how to give out the right cloud.properties file).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added support for using unencrypted keys directly instead of 
            needing to run proxy-init.  See the README for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            The properties 'nimbus.cert' and 'nimbus.key' are consulted
            first, then normal a grid proxy search is made, then ~/.nimbus is
            consulted, then ~/.globus.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means one less user step in many of the common ways people use
            the cloud client.  The new (optional) 'nimbus.cert' and
            'nimbus.key' properties also makes toggling between clouds easier.

            We are happy to announce the first version of the new Nimbus installer.
        </p>
        <p>
            It helps make useful initial configurations, eliminates the
            need for a separate Globus container installation, and sets up an
            embedded certificate authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            The installer also introduces the important new concept of "NIMBUS_HOME" on the services node.

<i>2.4 - Monitoring</i>

        <p>
                    
        The Nimbus Monitoring &amp; Discovery system has received a substantial overhaul since its first incarnation. The system still utilizes custom Nagios plugins to report worker node and head node resources. However, the Globus 4.x MDS utility is no longer used as the data registry. Instead, the system publishes XML to files to be served up by a web browser. A new utility, <a href="http://github.com/hep-gc/cloud-aggregator">Cloud Aggregator</a> has been developed separately to query these XML sources.

<i>2.3 - Services</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for the EC2 Query API.  Tested with the Python
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/boto/">boto</a> client but should
            work with others. The service does not run in the standard Globus container,
            it spawns a separate Jetty process. While installed by default, it requires
            configuration before it can be used.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            EC2 SOAP API support has been upgraded to version 2009-08-15. This means
            ec2-api-tools clients must be upgraded to
            <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-api-tools-1.3-42584.zip">
            this version</a>. Early work has been done to support multiple versions
            concurrently, but this functionality is not yet available.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The new Nimbus web portal is based on Django and is a standalone
            component with (in this version) no ties to the other Nimbus services. This
            component's current sole functionality to facilitate securely
            providing users with their X509 and query credentials.  It will be expanded in future releases to include more functionality for both users and administrators.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Context Broker has been refactored and merged into the main Nimbus
            source tree. It is installed by default but is not enabled because it
            needs configuration.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Nimbus Derby configuration now supports network access, though it
            is disabled by default. At install, passwords are generated and stored
            in <i>var/derby.properties</i>. The Nimbus service still uses the
            embedded interface. See

<i>2.3 - Control Agents</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The workspace-control component has been significantly refactored.
            It has been moved from <i>backend/</i> to <i>control/</i> in the
            source tree.
            Direct command-line invocation of Xen operations has been replaced with
            calls to the excellent <a href="http://libvirt.org/">libvirt</a>
            library. This opens the door to easier integration with several other
            hypervisors, starting with KVM.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>

<i>2.2 - Summary</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Introduction of the metadata server which mimics the EC2 HTTP
            query based metadata server.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Introduction of a standalone context broker, see the downloads
            page.  This runs by itself so that you can use just the context
            broker to contextualize virtual clusters on EC2.  No Nimbus cluster
            is necessary.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Bug fixes, see below for specifics.

    </li>
</ul>

<i>2.2 - Services</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added a metadata server which responds to VMs HTTP queries, using
            the same path names as the EC2 metadata server.  The URL for this
            is obtained by looking at <i>/var/nimbus-metadata-server-url</i>
            on the VM, which is an optional VM customization that can be made.
            See <i>"etc/nimbus/workspace-service/metadata.conf"</i> for the
            details.
        </p>
        <p>
            It responds based on source IP address so there is an
            assumption that the immediately local network is non-spoofable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The metadata server is disabled by default.
        </p>

            Introduction of a standalone context broker, see the downloads

            broker to contextualize virtual clusters on EC2.  No Nimbus cluster
            is necessary.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added user-data support to EC2 remote interfaces.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added user-data support to the WSRF operations, but namespaces did
            not change.  This maintains client forward compatibility.  If the
            user data element is missing, that is not an issue for the service.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added getGlobalAll to the RM API, see enhancement request
            <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6556">6556</a>
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
            Added <i>MetadataServer</i> module and user-data to <i>VM</i> to
            the RM API.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added user-data support to EC2 remote interfaces.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fixed these EC2 interface bugs:
            <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6530">wrong
            instance ID is returned</a> and

            instances fails with parameter</a>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fixed misc bugs
            <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6546">6546</a>
            and <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=6545">6545
            (pilot plugin initialization failure)</a>.
        </p>

<i>2.2 - Cloud client</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Current cloud client as of this release is cloud-client-011.  This
            supports contextualization using the new standalone context broker.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>
            A lone invocation of "--status" (which prints all your currently
            running instances) will now print the associated cloud handle
            of each workspace.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Java 1.5 (Java 5) is now a requirement
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The TP2.2 service side is backwards compatible with the "old
            style" contextualization but this cloud client only supports
            the new one.  <i>You can only use this against Nimbus TP2.1
            installations if you are not using contextualization</i>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for contextualizing easily with EC2 resources.  See the
            output of "--extrahelp" for the new "--ec2script" option.  Sample
            EC2 cluster.xml file is @ "samples/ec2basecluster.xml"
        </p>
        <p>
            This will take care of the context broker interactions for you and
            give you a suggested set of EC2 commands to run (including files
            for metadata) for the virtual cluster to contextualize while running
            on EC2.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fixed bug in the "lib/this-globus-environment.sh" script, the
            X509_CERT_DIR variable was being set incorrectly
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<i>2.2 - Context agent</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            A new version of the context agent is necessary to contextualize a
            virtual cluster with Nimbus TP2.2's metadata server and the new
            context broker.

        <p>
            An internal problem was fixed which made the logs wrong as well
            as causing problems for the client at destroy time.  In particular,
            a VM would be destroyed but the remote client would not hear the
            last notification of the event causing it to hang.

            Added a new option to create VMs with "tap:aio" instead of using
            the "file" method (these are Xen terms for methods of mounting
            the disks).  The "tap:aio" method is often
            used in Xen 3.2 setups and is now possible to use via
            workspace-control.  See the new <i>worksp.conf.sample</i>.

            "use matching initrd with kernel"
        </p>
        <p>
            This allows you to configure workspace-control to take the kernel
            filename it is launching a VM with and search for a matching
            initrd based on suffix rules you set up.  This allows you to
            easily use many of the Xen guest kernels that are created with popular
            Linux distributions.

            It can be used simultaneously alongside the previous remote

                <p>
                    One is the normal implementation where the
                    server-side generates a private and public key (using
                    <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">jsch</a>) and delivers
                    the private key to you.

            <li>

                <p>
                    The other (configured by default) is a break from the
                    regular semantics.  It allows the keypair "name" you
                    send in the request to be the name AND the public key value.
                    This means there is never a private key server-side and
                    also that you can keys you aready have on your system.

        <p>
            If you are familiar with a previous Nimbus versions (VWS), these
            ".conf" files hold anything found in the old "jndi-config.xml" file
            which you don't need to look at anymore.
            The files hold name=value pairs with surrounding comments.  They
            are organized by area: accounting.conf, global-policies.conf,
            logging.conf, pilot.conf, network.conf, ssh.conf, vmm.conf.

        <p>
            Added cloud-client cluster and contextualization support.  Includes
            new "--cluster" flag (see cloud-client CHANGES.txt for full changes
            there).

        <p>
            The regular commandline client has new flags for ensemble

<i>1.3.3.1 - Control Agents</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for gzip via filename-sense.  See cloud
            <a href="clouds/clusters.html#compression">notes</a> on image
            compression/decompression.  This can save a lot of time in cluster
            launch situations since the gzip/gunzip happens on the VMMs
            simultaneously, cutting transfer times (where there is contention)
            considerably.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Local-locked the control of dhcpd start and stop: now works for
            situations where multiple workspaces are deployed on a VMM
            simultaneously (such as one VM per core and launching as part of
            a cluster).  The DHCP adjustment was being excercised
            simultaneously, revealing the race.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            There is no need to change the workspace-control configuration
            file from a TP1.3.2 compatible one.  There is a new configuration
            if you want to use it, though.  The "[behavior] --> num_cpu_per_vm"
            configuration allows you to peg the number of vcpus that are
            assigned to every workspace.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can choose to not upgrade workspace-control at all if you don't
            want the features listed here.

            Clients may now send customization tasks with request, files on the
            image will be replaced with the content.  The cloud client, for
            example, is set up by default to send a customization request that
            sets up the workspace's "/root/.ssh/authorized_keys" file.

            See the <a href="doc/cloud.html">Cloud Guide</a> for an overview
            of a new set of configurations/conventions that allow for clients
            to get up and running in minutes even from laptops on NATs.
            Currently this comes at the cost of obscuring some features like
            group deployments and multiple NICs.

    <li>
        <p>
            Centralized MAC address allocations to the workspace service.  This
            allows all backend configurations files to be identical.
            Older/advanced configurations are still possible but not recommended
            unless necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a new configuration in the <i>jndi-config.xml</i> file that
            allows the administrator to define the valid prefix for MAC
            address selection.  See <i>WorkspaceFactoryService</i> ->
            <i>NetworkAdapter</i> -> <i>macPrefix</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once an IP is assigned a MAC address (during service initialization)
            it remains with that IP as long as it is configured as part of the
            network pools.  This ensures that local network devices can cache
            MAC/IP bindings without needing to be manually cleared (no need for
            unsolicited ARP reply to guarantee connectivity).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Introduction of the "groupauthz" plugin.  This comes directly with
            the workspace service (no separate plugin installation is
            necessary) but it is not enabled by default.  This authorization
            plugin supports different policies for different group members
            which you organize by inserting identities into different group
            files.
        </p>
        <p>
            The plugin can enforce the following policies.  The request data
            to check is determined on a per-request, per-client basis.
            The <b>limits</b> are defined on a per group basis (every caller
            identity must be a part of a group).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Maximum currently reserved minutes at one point in time.  If the
                caller has two other workspaces with 10 hours scheduled for each,
                the value being checked against this policy would be 20 hours
                plus whatever time the current request is.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum elapsed and currently reserved minutes at one point in
                time.  If the caller has one other workspace with 10 hours
                scheduled and 80 hours of recorded past usage, the value being
                checked against this policy would be 90 hours plus whatever time
                the current request is.  This is the all-time maximum usage cap.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum number of running workspaces at one point in time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum number of workspaces per request (the largest group
                request possible).
            </li>
            <li>
                The image node that must be specified.
            </li>
            <li>
                The image node base directory that must be specified.
            </li>
            <li>
                Support for identity-hash based image subdirectories
                (see the cloud setup documentation to understand this
                convention).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each policy can be set to disabled/infinite for specific groups
            if you desire.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Arbitrary file customization tasks may be sent with the workspace
            creation request.  The image is mounted on the VMM and the contents
            of the task are placed into the specified file.
        </p>
        <p>
            This requires <i>mount-alter.sh</i> support on the backend which
            expects the <i>mount -o loop</i> construct to work without specific
            filesystem selection.  i.e., this will not support workspaces with
            filesystems that the VMM kernels do not support.
        </p>
        <p>
            This requires three new <i>jndi-config.xml</i> configurations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>WorkspaceService</i> -> <i>home</i> -> <i>localTempDirectory</i></li>
            <li><i>WorkspaceService</i> -> <i>home</i> -> <i>scpPath</i></li>
            <li><i>WorkspaceService</i> -> <i>home</i> -> <i>backendTempDirectory</i></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Inclusion of alternate unpropagation URL.  This allows the client
            to specify the target URL for where the workspace is unpropagated.
            It can be specified as part of the creation request or overriden
            after deployment.  If the default shutdown mechanism was to destroy
            the workspace, this can still be used (with shutdown-save) to cause
            unpropagation to the given URL.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Authorization enhancement to support late-specified alternate
            unpropagation URL.  An operation to check the contents of a
            post-deployment alternate propagation URL request was added to the
            authorization callout interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            This can be used to filter out invalid requests.  For
            example, the groupauthz plugin discussed above will use the same
            logic here for image repository policy checking that it does at
            create time.  Previously, the authorization callout had only one
            operation which was called at creation time only.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Fault information can now be stored as part of the Corrupted state
            (for both RP queries and asynchronous state notifications).  This
            will help the remote client debug issues that can arise after a
            successful factory creation, such as "the file you specified to
            propagate does not exist at the image repository" etc.
        </p>

<i>1.3.2 - Reference clients</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Introduction of cloud-client system.  This consists of a wrapper
            program run from a specific directory setup that contains an
            embedded globus client installation among other things.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more information on the client and setting up a configuration
            to support it, see the <a href="doc/cloud.html">Cloud Guide</a>.
            To see some examples of end-user commands, see the
            <a href="clouds/">clouds</a> page.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The main client's help system was reorganized.  For help on options
            that are specific to an action, use "--help --<i>&lt;name of
            action&gt;</i>".  See the main "--help" output to get started.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The main client has a new "--exit-state" option that causes
            modes with subscriptions (in either poll or async mode) to wait
            for the specified state before exiting with success.  If the
            workspace moves to a terminal state (Corrupted etc.) then this
            is considered an error.  This is aimed at making scripts that
            wrap the client more effective.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The main client has a new "--save-target" option whose argument is
            an override to any previous unpropagation URL.  You can use this
            before or after deployment has succeeded (although it could fail
            because of authorization issues).  See the client's
            "-h --shutdown-save" output for more information.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Arbitrary customization tasks are possible by defining them in an
            optional parameters file.  But the main client now also includes a
            shortcut for the very common task of inserting your SSH public key
            as the desired contents of the <i>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</i>
            file on the VM.  See the client's "-h --deploy" output for more
            information on this new "--sshfile" option.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Support for post-deployment error printing (faults can now be
            included as part of Corrupted notifications).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Status client allows for a bulk query ("in one remote operation,
            show me a short update of all workspaces I manage at this service").
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Introduction of a base client API which abstracts operations out
            from the webservices implementation and provides common subscription
            tools, utility methods, etc.  (the main workspace client was
            internally reorganized to use this API: if you are a client
            developer you could examine this code for a lot of concrete usage
            samples).
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
            Fix for a bug where the lack of a gateway specification would cause
            a problem when inserting a workspace's DHCP policy.  Lack of a
            default gateway is legal (and sometimes necessary).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When DHCP configuration file cannot be found, a more helpful error
            is printed.

    <li>
        <p>
            Files on VMM were not being deleted in one unpropagate situation
            where they should have been.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The VM name prefix sent to the VMM has been shortened from
            "workspace" to "wrksp".  String length limits for NIC names were
            being reached too early ("wrksp" should accomodate workspace IDs in
            the millions).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            We are including a "foreign-subnet" script that allows VMMs to
            deliver IP information over DHCP to workspaces even if the VMM
            itself does not have a presence on the target IP's subnet.  This
            is an advanced configuration, you should read through the script's
            leading comments and make sure to clear up any questions before
            using.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is particularly useful for hosting workspaces with public IPs
            where the VMMs themselves do not have public IPs.  This is because
            it does not require a unique interface alias for each VMM (public
            IPs are often scarce resources).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added support for booting hard disk images (pygrub).  Resolves

            Client must specify mountpoint like "hda" instead of "hda1" for
            this to trigger.

            In some situations the sleep() system call that the pilot makes
            during an unexpected backout situation was returning too early.

<i>1.3.1 - Summary</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added support for workspace pilot resource management.  The pilot
            is a program the service will submit to a local site resource
            manager in order to obtain time on the VMM nodes.  When not
            allocated to the workspace service, these nodes will be used for
            jobs as normal (the jobs run in normal system accounts in Xen
            domain 0 with no guest VMs running).  See below.

            Several extra safeguards have been added to make sure the node is
            returned from VM hosting mode at the proper time, including support
            for:
            <ul>
                <li>the workspace service being down or malfunctioning</li>
                <li>LRM preemption (including deliberate LRM job cancellation)</li>
                <li>node reboot/shutdown</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Also included is a one-command "kill 9" facility for administrators
            as a "worst case scenario" contingency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the pilot is optional.  By default the service does not
            operate with it, the service instead directly manages the nodes it
            is configured to manage.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added functionality to ensure multiple workspaces (including groups
            of workspaces) are co-scheduled.  This includes the introduction
            of the Workspace Ensemble Service.  This functionality allows
            complex virtual clusters to have all its component workspaces be
            scheduled to run at once if that is necessary.  This works with
            both the default and pilot-based resource managers.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            All remote interfaces (WSDLs/schemas) have been updated with at
            least new namespaces.  You can examine them directly online at the
            WSDL and XSD files page
            (or read the descriptions on the
            Interfaces section).  The main
            difference is an extension to the factory create/deploy operation
            and the addition of the ensemble service.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            SSH based workspace-control invocations may now be configured
            with an alternate private key.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            SSH based workspace-control invocations now use options to ensure
            easier identification of misconfigurations (no password entry
            hang is possible now).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If using the pilot mechanisms, a new configuration section in the
            service configuration file needs to be uncommented for pilot
            specific configurations (see the configuration comments there).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If using the pilot mechanisms, a client may now not submit a flag
            to the factory that requests the workspace be unpropagated after
            the running time has elapsed.  Instead, unpropagation must be
            triggered manually by a client before this deadline is reached.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If using the pilot mechanisms, a shared secret must be configured
            in <i>etc/workspace_service/pilot/users.properties</i> for HTTP
            digest access authentication based notifications from the pilot.
            Use the included <i>shared-secret-suggestion.py</i> script.
            (alternatively SSH may be used for notifications but it is slower)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            New dependencies (these are distributed with the service):

                    - only necessary if using the pilot with the faster, default
                    HTTP digest access authentication based notifications.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <li>
        <p>
            Some platforms+JVMs have buffer size issues which caused some

            DHCP based network delivery to the VMs now requires unique
            hostnames for each allocatable address (even if they do not
            resolve to an IP).  This addresses
            <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5738">Bug #5738</a>.

<i>1.3.1 - Reference clients</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            A new client <i>workspace-ensemble</i> allows you to destroy
            all workspaces in a running ensemble as well as trigger the workspaces
            in the ensemble to be co-scheduled and (afterwards) allowed to
            launch.  This trigger is also available in the last workspace
            deployment of the ensemble, if desirable (this will save a web
            services operation).
        </p>
    </li>

        <p>
            Enhancement
            <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5795">Bug #5795</a>
            is addressed, this allows an early unpropagate request to be sent.
            The new <i>workspace</i> action is "--shutdown-save" and requires
            a single or group workspace EPR.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <i>workspace</i> program includes a new flag
            "--trash-at-shutdown" which allows callers to include a request
            that the service simply discards the VM after use (instead
            of unpropagating it).  This is typical behavior for virtual cluster
            compute nodes, for example.  The functionality itself is not
            new in this release, just this flag.  It allows you to include
            the flag when using commandline based resource requests as
            well as <i>override</i> a given resource request file with a
            trash-at-shutdown flag.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <i>workspace</i> program has improved output,
            especially in the cases where you are launching groups and
            ensembles.

<i>1.3 - Services</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            All remote interfaces, WSDLs/schemas, have been updated and also
            have new namespaces.  You can examine them directly online at the
            <a href="examples/compact/index.html">WSDL and XSD files</a> page
            (or read the descriptions on the
            <a href="interfaces/index.html">Interfaces</a> section).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <a href="interfaces/factory.html">Workspace Factory Service</a>
            was extended to support starting a homogenous group of workspaces
            in one deployment request.  A global maximum group size can be
            specified natively (without needing to use an authorization
            callout).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The <a href="interfaces/groupservice.html">Workspace
            Group Service</a> was added to manage groups after deployment.
            See the <a href="interfaces/index.html#groupoverview">group
            overview</a> on the main interfaces page.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Hooks for accounting modules were added.  These plugins allow you
            to track clients' used or reserved running time.  There are
            separate reader and writer interfaces for flexibility.  A default
            database backed implementation is provided and enabled by default.
            By default this implementation includes a periodic write to log
            files on the system (one for current reservations, another for
            major events).
            See <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=5443">Bug 5443</a>.
        </p>

    <li>
        <p>
            The <a href="interfaces/statusservice.html">Workspace
            Status Service</a> was added, it allows a Grid client to consult
            the usage statistics that the service has tracked about it.
            See <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=5444">Bug 5444</a>.

            Resource selection now favors VMMs not in use.  The previous
            selection process accepted the first VMM with enough memory
            which could result in a situation where e.g. two workspaces
            are running on one VMM but no workspaces are running on another.

    <li>
        <p>
            The client can subscribe and listen to many workspaces at a time
            after deploying a group.  As this can be quite verbose for large
            groups, there are two new options to control subscription output
            verbosity.  See the "-h" text.

        <p>
            There is a <i>numnodes</i> argument that will control how many

            JNDI class discovery is done differently, this may affect you if
            you have alternate implementations of any module or plugin
            interface.  A new workspace Initializable interface can be used.
            See the <i>org.globus.workspace.Locator</i> class.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Message intake and initial validation support is now implemented
            as a plugin, see the
            <i>org.globus.workspace.service.binding.BindingAdapter</i>
            interface.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The default scheduler's "node picking" support is now implemented
            as a plugin, see the
            <i>org.globus.workspace.scheduler.defaults.SlotManagement</i>
            interface.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            AllocateAndConfigure (association) support is now implemented as a
            plugin, see the
            <i>org.globus.workspace.network.AssociationAdapter</i> interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            New optional AccountingEventAdapter and AccountingReaderAdapter
            plugins, see the <i>org.globus.workspace.accounting</i> package.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The optional creation-time authorization callout interface was
            altered to include group requests as well as the caller's accrued
            used and reserved running minutes (if an accounting reader is
            running).

<h3>TP1.2.3</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Significant documentation updates including the addition of a
            guided <a href="doc/user-index.html">User Quickstart</a>
            and the Workspace Marketplace.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added the ability to specify multiple partitions for one VM.
            There is a restriction in this version that only one partition
            file may be used with the propagation mechanisms, the other
            partitions must be cached or on a shared filesystem.
            (<a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=5216">Bug 5216</a>)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added the ability to create blank partitions on the fly if
            the client specifies to do so by sending a storage request (the
            MB of blank space needed) in the resource requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently this hardcodes the filesystem to create on the blank
            partition (the default is ext2), in the future this may be
            specifiable by the client.
            (<a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/globus/show_bug.cgi?id=5215">Bug 5215</a>)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added an HTTP transfer adapter for pre- and post-deployment
            staging.  Included is the ability to provide checksums that
            will be checked after the transfer as well as decompression
            functionality.  For more details, see the
            <a href="interfaces/optional.html">Optional parameters</a>
            documentation.

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added the ability to choose hypervisors in the resource pool
            based on what networking associations they support.  For example,
            a request may arrive for a workspace to have NICs on two
            separate networks: the pool node selection algorithm will use
            the requirement to support both of these networks in its search.

            The workspace types schema, <i>workspace_types.xsd</i>, has a

<h3>TP1.2</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Added support for a resource pool model that allows one grid
            service to manage a large group of VMMs, sending incoming
            workspace deployment requests to appropriate VMM nodes for
            instantiation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            To support the resource pool model, managed file propagation
            support was added to move files associated with workspaces to
            and from the resource pool nodes and storage nodes.  The current
            choices are GridFTP and SCP.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            An optional RFT staging plugin is available to allow a deployment
            request to include a stage in and/or stage out directive.  This is
            to manage client file movement in the grid context as opposed to
            the managed, inter-site propagation functionality.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            To support host based authorization (which include a reverse IP
            check in its algorithm), IP pool entries may now optionally include
            matching certificate and key pairs that are moved on to the VM when
            it is allocated a particular networking address.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            New functionality is supported: create-paused, reboot.  A
            choice of default shutdown method when the maximum running time
            has been reached:  normal, trashed.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Logging choices for both the grid service and workspace-control
            program have been significantly enhanced.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The VMM workspace-control program has a new installer that will
            install the executable and create all of its necessary work
            directories and will review all directory and file permissions
            for safety (and correct problems if instructed to).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The VMM workspace-control program now employs a sudo callout to
            do its privileged work.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The VMM workspace-control program has been enhanced to isolate
            user files from each other and is set up with a safe environment
            for image altering.  A new /opt/workspace hierarchy is the default
            installation option but it allows for flexible choices.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The grid service portion has been significantly improved internally
            for asynchronous event handling, scalability and the ability to
            replace more of its subsystems with alternate or improved
            implementations.

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Support for a new, "Allocate" networking method that allows the
        workspace service administrator to specify pools of IP addresses (and
        DNS information) which are then assigned to virtual machines on
        deployment.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>The resource properties have been extended to publish deployment
        information about a workspace, such as its IP address.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Workspace metadata validation has been extended to support
           requirement checking for specific architecture, hypervisor
           version, and CPU. The workspace factory advertises the supported
           qualities as a resource property; the requirement section of
           workspace metadata is checked against the supported set.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Authorization handling has been significantly extended. The
           workspace service can now accept and process VOMS credentials
           and SAML attributes (GridShib).
           Further, an authorization callout has been added to the service
           for fine grain policies. This callout can be configured to
           implementations of a simple attribute list lookup or a python
           script allowing for arbitrary authorization logic.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Support for Xen3 has been added.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>The workspace client has been extended to accomodate new
        functionality. In addition the client interface has been extended to
        enable subscribing for notifications and specifying the resource
        allocation information at command-line.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Installation has been improved -- the client now requires only a
        minimal installation (as opposed to the full service installation).</p>
    </li>
